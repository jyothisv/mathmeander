# Higher Mathematics Knowledge Platform — MVP Architecture

**Status:** v17 — the unit-type/object-type mismatch fixed (the formal family — theorem/lemma/proposition/corollary/conjecture/claim — are first-class object types, enum-only; **materialization maps `type` by identity**); edge-driven materialization narrowed to canonical edges (markers structurally can't trigger it; AI edges only at acceptance); `links.status` gives stale edges a schema home (canonical edges only); `source_object_id` rename; exactly-one-of-four target invariant; type-qualified FK invariants; `anchor_kind` derived; tags join propagation + the ownership matrix. Reference architecture for the implementation spike; ownership prototype first — heavy AI/PDF work waits behind that gate.
**Scope basis:** the MVP direction document (§4–§7) plus architecture decisions reached in design discussion
**How to read this:** Sections 1–4 set scope and the one governing principle. Sections 5–11 are the architecture proper. Section 12 onward covers posture (sync, ops, testing), build sequencing, the decided language split, and the assumptions this draft rests on. If an assumption in §18 is wrong, the affected section will say which.

## 1. What this MVP is (and is not)

**MVP goal (§4):** prove the input loop — a serious learner inputs rough mathematical material and turns it into high-quality, interconnected, source-linked objects, with raw input preserved and everything exportable and migratable.

**In scope (§5):** rough math editor with LaTeX-compatible math and object blocks; the core object types (note, definition, the **formal family** — theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary, conjecture, claim —, proof, example, question, source_excerpt, trail, annotation); PDF selection-to-object with source provenance; trails and breadcrumbs with light refinement; Inbox and Review Queue; notation snippets + registry; linking, aliases, backlinks, typed relationships; a small set of built-in AI workflows; and export/import + migration *foundations*.

**Reserved, not built (schema must accommodate, no UI):** the entire **computational exploration pillar** (§3.16, §4 explicit) — object types and relationship types reserved in the model; no generator runtime, no GPU, no client experiment engine. **Structured diagrams** are likewise reserved (diagram object type + structured diagram model reserved, no renderer/editor/codegen) — cut from MVP scope to shrink the build (§14). Also reserved: equation-subexpression anchoring, multi-device sync, native apps, BYOK, and richer export targets (Typst/LaTeX/PDF).

**Explicit non-goals (§6):** full graph/map UI, workflow editor, **mobile app, full desktop app**, collaboration, social publishing, handwritten import, spaced review, proof-pattern library, convention ontology, reference-manager replacement, broad diagram illustration, proof-assistant integration, theorem discovery, general CAS, arbitrary code execution, full computational UI.

The discipline throughout is §2.1: **narrow but structurally honest** — the surface is small, the model anticipates the whole direction.

---

## 2. The one governing principle

Everything below serves a single decision (§3.18): there is **one canonical model** — mathematical objects + a typed object graph + a mathematics-first content model (`MathContent`, §6.0) + provenance — and **every syntax, library, and renderer is an adapter around it**. Markdown, LaTeX, Typst, HTML, PDF.js, ProseMirror, KaTeX, and the LLM are all importers, exporters, or views. None of them is ever the source of truth. The content model in particular is derived from *how we preserve the user's mathematics*, not from any editor's document shape.

The single test applied to every choice in this document: *does it keep the canonical model canonical, or does it tempt some library's internal format to become the truth?* The latter is the precise debt the source document warns against ("a diagram should not be stored only as a generated image"; "AI output should not silently become user-authored knowledge").

This is enforced architecturally by isolating the canonical model and all operations on it into one module — **the integrity core** — with a hard boundary, and treating it as the part of the system that stabilizes first and is guarded by property tests.

The horizontal lines are **seams**, and each is a real separation of concerns, not just a layer label:

- **core ↔ glue** separates *pure, slow-changing, integrity-critical* logic (Rust) from *impure, fast-changing* I/O (TypeScript). The seam is an **in-process FFI boundary via napi-rs** — accepted (§17) in exchange for the TS AI ecosystem and one language across glue + frontend. Either way the core never does I/O.
- **AI ↔ core** separates *non-deterministic, network-bound, fast-churning* orchestration from the deterministic core. The AI tier calls into the core; it never becomes part of it. (The larger the AI surface, the more this seam earns its keep — §8.)
- **frontend ↔ backend** is the network boundary; the frontend's canonical types are *generated from* the core so drift surfaces at build time.

## 4. Stack at a glance

| Concern | Choice | Rationale (ties to the brief) |
|---|---|---|
| Integrity core | **Rust** (pure crate) | Canonical model integrity is the product thesis (§2.2). Enums + exhaustive matching make "handle every variant," versioned serialization, and non-destructive migration compiler-enforced, not test-hoped. |
| Glue + AI tier | **TypeScript (Node)** + Rust core via **napi-rs** (§17 — decided) | AI is heavy in *behavior* (§8); the TS LLM/streaming ecosystem + one language across glue and frontend outweigh the FFI seam. Core stays Rust. |
| Object content | **`MathContent`** — a mathematics-first content model (§6.0), *not* an editor doc | First-class units (prose/expression/…) with one user-facing `type`; per-unit crystallization; ProseMirror/KaTeX are frontend adapters only. |
| Data model | **Explicit, transparent schema** — JSONB only for documented-variant structures + snapshots (§6) | The schema documents the model by being it; references become edges (§6.1b); provenance/trail/detail are typed tables. |
| Notation | **Notation registry** (entries + conventions) distinct from **snippets** | Snippet = input shortcut; NotationEntry = meaning/canonicalization; Reference = inserted semantic atom (§6, §6.3a, §3.12). |
| Concurrency | **Optimistic** — `revision` + `expected_revision`, version-bound AI candidates (§6.4) | Single-session removes *merge*, not *concurrency* (tabs, stale state, async jobs). |
| DB access | **TS query layer** + Rust core for pure transforms | SQL-first against an explicit schema; the Rust core (via napi-rs) does validation/migration/serialization. |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** | One datastore: explicit relational schema + `pg_trgm` fuzzy refs + `tsvector` search + reserved `pgvector`. No graph DB (traversals are 1–2 hops). |
| IDs | **UUIDv7 (ULID-style)** | Sortable, **client-mintable**, collision-free — stable and portable for `.mathpack`; reserves offline-create and multi-device. |
| Jobs | **pg-boss / BullMQ** (Node) | Extraction, export rendering, (reserved) embeddings. |
| Frontend shell | **React + Vite + TanStack Router/Query + Zustand** | Client-side workspace, not an SEO site; SSR would fight the editor/PDF. |
| Editor | **ProseMirror via TipTap** + **InputEnvironment** system (§9.x) | Edits a *projection* of `MathContent`; environments drive context-sensitivity (theorem vs proof vs source-note); position-mapping underpins anchors (§3.14). Yjs-ready. |
| Math | **KaTeX** renders the expression *surface*; meaning via refs (§6.3a) | "LaTeX canonical" = renderable surface, not meaning. MathML/parsed-tree upgrade reserved for subexpression anchoring (§7). |
| PDF | **PDF.js as substrate** (react-pdf only if it doesn't obstruct) + multi-selector anchors | Source as an addressable place (§3.6); anchors degrade gracefully (§3.10). Prototype wrapper vs. direct PDF.js early. |
| Diagrams | **Reserved, not in MVP** (§14) — diagram object type + structured model reserved | Cut from MVP scope to shrink the build; "structured data, not pixels" (§3.13) preserved for when it lands. |
| AI | TS; serde-schema'd structured outputs → **Review Queue**; **3 workflows first** | Version-bound typed candidates with provenance; no AI pollution (§2.5, §3.9). No heavy orchestration framework. |
| Type sharing | **Versioned schema artifact emitted by the core** → ts-rs/specta + zod | Frontend + glue types generated from the Rust core; drift caught at build (§7). |
| Export/import | **`.mathpack`** (core: manifest+serialization; glue: zip+asset I/O — §10); **Markdown/HTML** | Lossless by construction (§3.17, §5.10); purity scoped to the core's projections. Typst/LaTeX/PDF + Pandoc reserved. |
| Auth | **Hosted IdP** (e.g. Clerk/WorkOS/Auth.js), JWT verified server-side | Don't roll auth. Single-session enforced server-side as a policy. |
| Storage | **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible), content-hashed | Zero egress for repeatedly served PDFs/assets. |
| Hosting | **Container** (Fly.io / Railway) | Long-running server (Node + the Rust addon); container needed when export later shells to Typst/Pandoc. |
| Observability | **structured logs + Sentry** | Logs + error tracking. |
| Testing | **Rust core proptest** + integration tests + **Playwright** | Plus mandatory migration and export/import round-trip suites (§5.10). |

## 5. The integrity core (Rust)

This is the architectural bet. It is a **pure, I/O-free, framework-free crate** — no database calls, no HTTP, no clock except what's passed in. Its job is to define the canonical model and the total functions over it.

**Contents:**
- the canonical **type definitions** — objects, the `MathContent` content model (§6.0), edges/references, aliases, annotations, the provenance type, object states, anchor selectors;
- **validation** — turning untrusted input into a valid canonical value or a typed error;
- **schema migration** — total functions `v_n → v_{n+1}`, non-destructive;
- **serialization** — `serde`, the exact wire/storage shape, versioned;
- **canonical operations** — the meaning-changing edit operations (§6.0a);
- **export/import** — the `.mathpack` manifest/serialization and readable-format projections, as pure functions over the model.
- *(The diagram model and its TikZ codegen are **reserved**, not in the MVP core — §14.)*

**Why Rust here, specifically.** The product's entire promise is that user-authored and user-accepted material is never silently lost or corrupted across change (§2.2). Rust's sum types with exhaustive matching make it a *compile error* to add an object variant or split one and forget a site that handles it; `serde` makes every shape change an explicit, versionable serialization decision; migration functions can be checked total. For this domain these are not friction — they are the product invariants enforced by the compiler rather than hoped for in tests. (Gradual crystallization, §2.4, is preserved by keeping not-yet-formalized fields deliberately loose in the types and tightening as they settle; that is crystallizing the *model* gradually while refusing to crystallize *correctness* gradually.)

**The one Rust cost, and how this design neutralizes it.** Ownership/borrowing friction — the one genuinely domain-irrelevant Rust tax — bites hardest on long-lived, shared, mutable, cross-referential in-memory object graphs. This core is deliberately **not** that. It is *transformations over owned, tree-shaped canonical values*: take a value, validate/migrate/serialize/transform, return a value. The object graph's cross-references live as **IDs referencing IDs in the store**, loaded as data when needed — not as in-memory pointers between mutable Rust objects. Structured this way, the borrow checker barely engages in the layer where Rust is used. The discipline to hold: never model the live graph as an in-memory web of interlinked mutable objects.

**Compiles to WASM (reserved).** Because the core is pure and I/O-free, compiling it to WASM later is essentially free. For the MVP it runs **server-side only**; the frontend gets *type definitions* via codegen, not the runtime. When offline/native arrives (§7), the same crate compiled to WASM gives every client identical validation/migration — one integrity implementation across server and every shell. This is reserved, not built now.

---

## 6. Data model (concrete first cut)

Illustrative, not final. Two principles govern this model, both following directly from "preserve the user's mathematical world transparently":

1. **The model is derived from mathematics, not from the editor.** Its vocabulary is what a mathematician would use to describe their own work — objects, statements, hypotheses, conclusions, expressions, references, justifications, conventions. It is *not* the vocabulary of a rich-text editor (nodes, marks, blocks, spans) or a renderer (KaTeX). ProseMirror and KaTeX are **adapters in the frontend only**; the core model does not know they exist. Rule of thumb: *if an editor or rendering term appears in a core type name, that's a bug.*

2. **The schema is transparent: explicit structure is the default, JSONB is the rare, justified exception.** Everything relational and queried — the object graph, references and occurrences, **the content units and their types**, provenance, trail structure, the key fields of anchors — is **explicit schema** (the schema documents the model by *being* the model). JSONB is reserved for two narrow cases: (a) a genuinely variant, **documented** structure (a per-workflow AI candidate; an `extracted_structure` candidate), and (b) snapshots/logs/derived data (AI context snapshots, the search projection). It is never a dumping ground for structure that should be visible. A unit's authored `content` is stored in a **specified, versioned, domain-derived format** (`unit_content` — transparent because the core owns its spec), *not* as opaque editor state; and nesting is **rows**, never embedded trees (§6.0).

### 6.0 The content model — `MathContent`, a flowing sequence of `Unit`s

The content *inside* an object (a theorem and its surrounding thinking, a note's body, a proof's steps) is the part most at risk of being modeled as "editor state" — or, just as bad, as a rigid form. It is neither. It is a representation of **mathematical writing and thinking**: narrative, exploratory, recursive, crystallizing **per part** from rough to precise (§2.4). The model is built on three principles earned over the design discussion:

- **Structure is progressive, local, and reversible.** Rough prose can become typed structure gradually (*progressive*); one sentence can be classified without classifying the rest (*local*); a label can be removed without losing content (*reversible*). At any moment an object can be 100% rough flowing prose and be completely valid — richness is captured *when present* precisely because it is *never forced*.
- **The user performs one classifying act per unit; everything else is inferred or optional.** A person types `Thm.` or `Idea:` — one gesture, one concept. They never choose a "carrier shape" or fill fields. A keyword may expand to several internal facets, but the user only ever performs one act.
- **Types carry the user's chosen meaning; shape is inferred; deeper structure is never required for editing.**

So a `Unit` has **one user-facing axis** (`type`); its authored material is `content`, whose form is internal:

```
MathContent { units: Unit[] }          // ordered; per-unit state — no global rough/structured flip

Unit {
  id            // UUID — what annotations anchor to, AI candidates target, edges point at
  type?         // THE one user-facing label (the unit's function in the math flow). Optional:
                //   absent = plain content. Curated, UI-grouped vocabulary (below).
  content       // UnitContent — the AUTHORED MATERIAL, a tagged union whose tag
                //   (content.kind: prose | math | list | derivation | case_split | embed
                //   | group) is its AUTHORITATIVE discriminator — INTERNAL, inferred or
                //   structurally entered, never a classification the user makes. It is
                //   not a second semantic axis: it only tells consumers how to read
                //   `content`. Any SQL content_kind column is a DERIVED projection
                //   (one fact, one home — §6.0b).
  extracted_structure?  // OPTIONAL candidate decomposition (hypotheses / conclusion /
                        //   dependencies) — proposed by the LLM or confirmed by the user,
                        //   NEVER required for ordinary editing (§6.0b)
  status        // per-unit crystallization: rough | parsed | user_verified | stale (§2.4)
  declared_by   // user | deterministic | imported — who declared this unit's STRUCTURE
                //   (type/kind), a separate fact from content provenance. `ai` is deliberately
                //   absent: AI proposals are review_items, never canonical units; acceptance
                //   enters as `user`, with provenance recording AI origin + derivation (§3.9)
  provenance_id
}
```

The `type` vocabulary is **the user-facing role/category of a unit in the mathematical flow** — the things a user would naturally "mark this as." Some values are flow-roles (motivation, intuition, proof_idea); some are artifact-categories (theorem, proof, example) — and notably, the artifact-like ones are the **candidates for object identity**: most auto-materialize on declaration, while some — a local `claim` — materialize when explicitly tracked or when an edge requires identity (§9.y). The vocabulary's two flavours still track the materialization split, just not as a strict equality. It spans the *whole* flow of mathematical thought, not just finished artifacts, so the platform never biases users toward polished exposition (the central tension of §2.2/§2.4):

```
Formal / claim-like:  theorem · lemma · proposition · corollary · definition
                      · conjecture · claim · question
Reasoning:            proof · proof_step
Thinking (the "living-math" layer): motivation · intuition · idea · proof_idea
                      · remark · observation · warning · analogy · application
                      · open_issue · return_later · note
Examples:             example   (example_kind: illustrative | worked | non_example)
(absent)              plain content
```

Note what is **not** in this list: `list`, `group`, `embed`, `derivation`, `case_split` are *forms*, not math-flow functions — "mark as Idea" is a sensible user act, "mark as group" is not — so they live in `content.kind`, never in `type`. A derivation or case-split is *entered* via a structured-insert gesture (start an aligned chain, add cases); that gesture sets the **content kind**, while the unit's `type` stays whatever it is (often `proof_step`, or none). Examples of the separation:

```
type = intuition      content.kind = prose        "Compactness prevents escape."
type = proof_idea     content.kind = list         three bullet steps
type = question       content.kind = math         a displayed proposition, asked
type = theorem        content.kind = group        prose + display math, as child rows
type = (none)         content.kind = derivation   an aligned =/≤ chain inside a proof
```

Why one axis and not two. An earlier draft split this into `kind` (shape) × `role` (force), which then needed an admissibility table to forbid nonsense like `assertion + question` — because "assertion" smuggled *force* into a *shape*. That collision is gone: **`type` carries force and meaning; `content.kind` carries form only**, and the two are independent because form is purely representational — an `intuition` may be prose *or* math; a `question` may be prose *or* a displayed proposition. The user picks `type`; the deterministic layer infers `content.kind` from syntax + type (§9.y). There is no cross-product of two semantic axes to police, so the admissibility table is deleted.

`UnitContent` variants (mathematical or durable authored structure — never a rendering affordance). **One nesting mechanism, rows only:** a container's children are **rows** (`parent_unit_id` + `position` + `slot`); a unit's `content` holds only its *own* material/attributes, never an embedded unit tree. This is the units-are-rows decision (§6.0b) applied consistently — an embedded tree would have no row identity for anchors, edges, or AI targets.

```
prose       { text, inline: [ mark | math(MathExpression) | Reference ] }
            // prose + inline formatting + INLINE math + mentions. Inline $…$ math is an
            // ELEMENT of prose, NOT its own unit — else one sentence explodes into units.
math        { expr: MathExpression }       // a PLACEMENT of one display/block MathExpression —
                                           //   NOT a separate math model (§6.3a)
list        { ordered: bool }              // items are child rows
derivation  { }                            // steps are child rows; each step child carries its

case_split  { }                            // each case = a child group; `slot` marks the
                                           //   assumption child vs body children
group       { }                            // THE generic container — a typed unit's multi-part

                                           //   already carries inline math/references/marks.)
embed       { target: ObjectRef | SourceExcerptRef }   // quotes & object embeds

//   Dependencies are NEVER hidden inside content.
// theorem/definition/intuition/etc. carry prose/math/group content; their *force* is the type,
//   their *decomposition* (hypotheses/conclusion) is optional extracted_structure, not units.

Occurrence { selector, target: Object | Notation }   // a semantic ref INSIDE a MathExpression
                                                      //   (`Symbol` RESERVED with BoundVar — no binder model in MVP)
RESERVED:  BoundVar (+ binder / scope / constraints / quantifier structure) — see below
```

What makes this domain-derived, not editor-derived (and not form-derived):

- **The living-math layer is first-class.** Motivation, intuition, idea, proof-idea, question, open-issue are *types a user can apply to ordinary content*, anywhere in the flow — so "Question. / Motivation. / Theorem. / Idea. / Proof. / Example." is representable as a flowing sequence of typed units, not forced into objects or lost. This is what keeps the model honest about *thinking*, not just *exposition*.
- **Typed units are not unique per object, and need not be contiguous.** One unit has exactly **one** `type` — but an object may contain *many* units of the same type, scattered: a theorem object may carry several `intuition` units, each illustrating a different aspect. Because content is an ordered list and `type` is per-unit, "many intuitions, interleaved" is the default behaviour of a sequence, not a feature. (Consequence for rendering/query in §6.0b.)
- **`Reference` (in prose) vs. `Occurrence` (in math) stay distinct.** "As in [[Bolzano–Weierstrass]]" in prose is a `Reference`; the `f`, `X`, `Y` *inside* `f : X → Y` are `Occurrence`s. Both **extract into graph edges** (§6.1b); neither is "a span styled as a link."
- **Decomposition is deferred, not demanded — and a type fixes the *role*, never the form.** Declaring `type = theorem` fixes the unit's math-flow role; `content.kind` is inferred from the **authored material or structural-insert gesture**, never from the type (a theorem may be one prose paragraph, a single display expression, or a group of parts). The form is still known immediately (*shape-now*) — because the material is — while the hypotheses/conclusion breakdown is optional `extracted_structure`, typically LLM-proposed and user-confirmed later (*decomposition-later*). So a theorem can be one rough sentence forever.

**`extracted_structure` is never canonical knowledge.** It is a candidate/working layer, and every payload carries a **mandatory envelope**: `{ kind, schema_version, generated_by, base_object_revision, accepted_into? }` — the same version-binding discipline as review candidates (§6.4), at unit scale (units carry no revision of their own; the object's concurrency token is the binding), so a decomposition proposed against revision 4 cannot be silently confirmed at revision 9, and acceptance is auditable via `accepted_into`. On acceptance it **materializes into the real model** — into units, into `links`, or into confirmed, specified typed metadata for sub-unit spans — rather than accreting as a parallel truth. The kinds form a **small named registry, each with a schema and a defined acceptance operation**: `hypothesis_conclusion_decomposition` (accept → confirmed typed metadata with selectors, or a split into units) and `proof_dependency_suggestion` (accept → `links` rows); the registry grows deliberately. Note that *unit-type suggestions are review_items, not extracted_structure* — this field holds analysis of a unit's *content*, never proposals about the unit itself. The enforcement rule: **if a structure affects graph, search, rendering, or trust, it must live in units, links, typed metadata, or review items — never only in `extracted_structure`.** Guardrail: this field must not become the new black-box `structured jsonb` this model eliminated (§6).

**Bound variables are reserved, deliberately.** A `BoundVar` without binder, scope, and constraints implies a binding structure the model doesn't capture and would mislead AI context — and modelling quantifier scope properly drifts toward formal-logic semantics, a §6 proof-assistant non-goal. In MVP, `ε` in "for every `ε > 0`" is just expression surface; binder/scope is reserved.

**The guardrail: semantic, not formal.** `MathContent` captures the structure and references the user has *expressed*; it is **not** a machine-checkable formal representation. Expressive enough to hold structure when the user provides it; humble enough to hold rough units when they don't.

**Adapters (frontend only).** The editor edits a *projection* of these units; the renderer renders the *surfaces* of expressions. These are the adapters the governing principle demands, living entirely in the frontend:

```
MathContent ↔ ProseMirror document   (the editing surface — a projection, not the model)
Expression.surface_text → KaTeX      (rendering — a projection of one field)
MathContent → HTML / Markdown        (readable export, MVP)
MathContent → Typst / LaTeX          (reserved)
MathContent → AI context (§8) · search projection (§6.3b)
```

Each unit's `content` is serialized in a **specified, versioned core format** (transparent — meanings fixed by the core's spec, not an editor; "payload" jargon avoided deliberately — this is the user's authored material); unit identity, order, `type`, `content.kind`, `status`, `declared_by`, and nesting are **explicit schema** (§6.0b). No serialized content is load-bearing for interconnection — references and occurrences are lifted into edges.

### 6.0a Canonical operations (the core owns *edits*, not just shapes) — a two-tier model

Defining `MathContent`'s *shape* isn't enough. If the editor mutates a projection freely and POSTs the whole thing back, the core degrades into an after-the-fact validator and the editor's transactions silently become the real semantic operation log — reintroducing, through the back door, the editor-as-truth problem §6.0 just closed. So the core also defines **canonical operations** over *units*, two-tier (a full op-per-keystroke API would fight the editor):

- **Meaning-changing operations → named core operations**, mostly *unit*-level: `set_unit_type` (apply/clear a type — a single act, even when it implies a shape and opens a relation), `split_unit` / `merge_units` (with defined, non-destructive propagation of type, annotations, provenance, **tags**; expression ids are **preserved** by move/split/merge, **minted fresh** by copy, **referenced** by transclude — part of the canonical operation tests, §6.3a), `toggle_expression_placement` (inline ↔ display; preserves `MathExpression.id`, §6.3a), `resolve_occurrence` (a symbol in an expression → a notation/object target), `insert_reference`, `attach_annotation_anchor` / `reanchor_annotation`, `accept_extracted_structure` (confirm an LLM decomposition), `accept_ai_candidate`, `materialize_object` (a span of units → a new object + edge — fired silently when an object-worthy type is declared, §9.y, or explicitly via extract/reuse actions). The frontend issues these as commands (carrying `expected_revision`, §6.4); the core validates and applies; the glue persists the result + a version.
- **Prose-level edits → coarse validated content sync.** Editing the `text` of a unit can use the editor locally and sync a coarse update the core *validates* on save. No per-keystroke op log.

For MVP the line can sit generously toward coarse sync, but the direction is named: **semantic edits are unit operations the core owns; prose edits are validated content.** Because each operation maps an edit back to the *same* unit id, a unit keeps its type, provenance, and anchored annotations across inline editing; `split`/`merge` are the explicit places where that propagation is decided (their semantics — what happens to type, annotations, occurrences — are specified and prototyped early, §9.y/§13a).

### 6.0b Object content is flowing units; structure is per-unit, not typed fields

A math object's content is **one flowing `MathContent`** (an ordered unit sequence) — *not* a fixed layout of typed content fields. This is the Q1 decision: a proof is a freeform mixture of prose, claims, proof-steps, derivations, partial conclusions, *and* the questions/ideas/intuitions sprinkled through it, and forcing that into `statement`/`hypotheses`/`conclusion` columns would be too rigid and would fight gradual crystallization (§2.4).

**`object.type` ≠ `unit.type` — stated once, plainly.** `object.type` is **durable workspace identity** (this row is a theorem object: findable, linkable, exportable on its own); `unit.type` is a **local math-flow label inside authored content**. The two coexist by design: a theorem *object* typically contains a `theorem`-typed unit (its statement) plus motivation/intuition/proof-idea/example units; a *note* object may contain theorem-*like* content that is not yet declared (or is only an AI candidate) — the moment the user *declares* `Thm.`, a draft theorem object materializes behind the scenes (§9.y greedy capture): **declaration, not later reuse, is the graph-entry event.** A `theorem`-typed unit may thus materialize an object with `object.type = theorem` — same word, **different layers**; neither implies the other's lifecycle. This holds across the whole formal family by one rule: **every materializable unit type has an identical object type — materialization maps `type` by identity** (`lemma → lemma`, `conjecture → conjecture`, edge-materialized `claim → claim`). No family object type carries a detail table, so the object-type extension is enum-only — and the unit-type and object-type vocabularies can never drift apart again for this family.

- **Types, not fields, carry "what a theorem says."** "The statement of this theorem" = its `theorem`/`claim`/`conjecture`-typed unit(s); rendering and export present them set-apart by *reading types*, computed on demand. The finer hypotheses/conclusion breakdown is optional `extracted_structure` (§6.0), not stored fields. So you keep a structured *view* without structural *rigidity*, and an untyped theorem is still just flowing units.
- **Typed units are not unique per object and need not be contiguous — and renderers must respect that.** A theorem may carry several `intuition` units (and several `example`, `remark`, `proof_idea` units) scattered through its flow, each on a different aspect. "Show the intuitions for this theorem" is therefore `units WHERE type = intuition ORDER BY position` — a renderer or exporter must **gather scattered same-type units**, never assume one-per-object. (Attachment is by co-location: these intuitions are about the object they sit in. An intuition about *one specific distant thing* is instead an **edge**, §6.1b — the usual intrinsic-vs-relational split.)
- **Only genuine non-content metadata stays a typed field.** A definition's **definiendum (`term`)** is object identity, so it's a small column (§6.1c); `proves`, `depends_on`, `uses` are **edges**. There are no `statement`/`hypotheses`/`conclusion` content columns.
- **Units are rows (`content_units`), not a blob.** This gives units the stable identity the rest of the model needs (anchors, AI targets, edge sources) and keeps the model transparent. Nesting (group/list/case_split children) is via `parent_unit_id` + `position`.

**Variants, alternatives, and reformulations are objects + edges — never fields, never new object types.** This is the general answer to "multiple proofs," "informal vs. formal definitions," etc.:
- *Multiple proofs of one theorem* = multiple **proof objects**, each with its own `proves` edge to the theorem (many-to-one); "the theorem's proofs" is the backlink query. A proof's **flavour** ("elementary", "slick", "by contradiction") is the proof object's own `type`-label or a **user tag** — not a field on the theorem.
- *Informal and formal definitions of one notion* = two **definition objects** joined by an `equivalent_to` edge (MVP uses `equivalent_to`; `reformulates`/`refines` reserved). The informal-vs-formal distinction is just each object's content/typed units; no per-type "intuition slot" is added to definitions.
- The rule: the graph already expresses "many things related to one thing"; that *is* the representation. A field-based design would force `proofs[]`/`definitions[]`/`flavour` enums; the object-graph-plus-labels model absorbs all of it with no new primitives.

**References and occurrences extract into graph edges — never load-bearing only inside a unit's content.** When a proof references theorem X, or an `Occurrence` inside math denotes the naturals, that relationship is a row in `links` (§6.1b) carrying its source `unit_id` — queryable, in backlinks, visible to the graph. The unit keeps only a *local* marker (a `Reference` in prose, an `Occurrence` selector in math) for rendering position. This is the concrete payoff of transparency: interconnection (§3.1, §3.10) works because it's in the schema.

Two downstream consequences: the **search projection** (§6.3b) flattens text across an object's units; and **annotation anchors** (§6.2) gain a precise `UnitRef { unit_id }` selector — "this hypothesis" anchors to a unit id, cleaner than a path into a field.

**Three distinct concepts, deliberately separated:** a **Snippet** is an *input shortcut*; a **NotationEntry** is the *meaning/display/canonicalization* (and optional link to a definition object); a **SymbolRef/NotationRef** is the *semantic atom actually inserted into the document* (§6.3a). So `;NN` is one way to *input* a reference to the notation entry for the naturals — and what lands in the document can be `{type: notation_ref, notation_id, surface: "NN"}` rather than a bare `\mathbb N` string, where the user has accepted semantic resolution. (Plain display math with no accepted resolution still stores bare LaTeX — see §6.3a.)

**Future-reserved object families (§5.2).** The computational families — `computational_exploration`, `computational_output`, `saved_observation`, `parameter_setting`, `comparison_experiment` — and the relationship types `visualizes / generated_by / observation_from / parameter_variant_of / compares_with` are **reserved as a namespace**, but I'd *not* commit fully-named Rust/Postgres enum variants for the computational **object** types yet. Reasoning (a refinement of the earlier draft): Rust's exhaustiveness already makes *adding* a variant later a safe, compiler-guided change — it shows you every match site to update — so pre-declaring named variants buys little, while committing a name into a Postgres enum (where rename/remove is painful) risks lock-in to a shape that is, by the whole computational discussion, still genuinely uncertain. The cheap reservation is therefore: keep the **relationship-type** names (more stable, and Postgres enum *additions* are easy), document the object-family namespace, and add the object-type variants when their minimal schema is known. **Postgres enums vs. `text` + core validation.** Native PG enums are convenient but painful to rename/remove. Since this platform will *evolve* object families, the recommendation is: store the **evolving** kinds — `object_type`, `relationship_type`, `notation_kind`, `review_kind`, `convention_kind` — as **`text` validated by the Rust core** (which holds the authoritative enum, optionally enforced by a migration-generated `CHECK`), so adding/renaming a value is a core change + cheap migration rather than a fraught `ALTER TYPE`. Reserve native PG enums for the genuinely stable, rarely-changing sets (e.g. `object_status`). Type safety still lives in the core either way; this is only about how the DB column is typed.

### 6.1 Provenance (a typed table, §6 schema)

Provenance is a **typed table** (not a per-row JSONB blob), so it is queryable and auditable; every provenanced entity carries a `provenance_id`. Its fields are explicit (see the `provenance` table above): `origin`, `created_by`, `occurred_at`; for AI origin, `model` + `prompt_template` + `context_snapshot_id`; for imported, `source_id` + `source_locator`; plus a derivation chain in **`provenance_derivations`** (a typed, FK-checked join table rather than a `uuid[]` — provenance is trust-central). The `model` field is deliberately **open-ended** text, not a closed enum of the two default models — the cheap reservation that lets a future BYOK/BYO-endpoint feature record "generated by the user's local model" without a migration. Origin-specific fields are nullable-by-origin and enforced by the core (§6.1a).

### 6.1a Core validation invariants (polymorphic refs SQL can't enforce)

Several fields are **polymorphic references** that a relational schema can't FK-check, so the **core owns these invariants** as part of validation — they are exactly the integrity rules the Rust core exists to guarantee:

- **Type-qualified object references** (SQL cannot cheaply express these; the core enforces them): every `*_detail.object_id` must reference an object of the matching type; `trail_steps.trail_id` must reference a `trail`; `annotation_targets.annotation_id` an `annotation`.
- **Link-target discipline** (§6.1b): a non-content row (`from_content = false`) must carry `target_object_id`; notation/source targets imply `from_content = true`; `target_unit_id` implies `target_object_id` and same-object membership (composite FK). This is what keeps the typed knowledge graph object-only as a *validated invariant*, not a convention.
- **`*.scope` ↔ `*.scope_ref` consistency** (for `notation_entries`, `conventions`, `aliases`): `global` → `scope_ref` IS NULL; `space` → NULL or equals `space_id`; `source` → references `sources(id)`; `trail`/`document` → references `objects(id)` of the expected type; `environment` → a known InputEnvironment id. A `source` scope pointing at a trail id is a validation error.
- **`links.target_selector` / `annotation_targets.anchor`** must reference an existing object (or source) and, where a sub-target is given, a selector shape valid for that target type.
- **`provenance` origin-fields**: AI fields present iff `origin='ai'`, import fields iff `origin='imported'`, etc.
- **`base_refs` (review_items)** must reference objects/sources that exist; stale revisions are *allowed* (that's the point — they trigger rebase, §6.4) but malformed refs are rejected.

These are property-tested alongside serialization and migration (§16).

### 6.1b References and occurrences are edges (not buried in content)

The `links` table is the single home of relationships — deliberate typed links *and* both flavours of content reference (§6.0b): a `Reference` in prose and an `Occurrence` inside an expression. Each content-derived edge carries `from_content = true`, its **`source_unit_id`** (which unit it sits in), `in_expression` (true for occurrences), and a `content_locator` — for occurrences, **`{expression_id, char_span}`** (§6.3a), which is stable across inline/display toggles and surrounding prose edits; for prose references, a span within the unit. The canonical relationship lives in the edge, so backlinks and graph queries see it; the unit keeps only a local marker for rendering. **Targets are polymorphic but constrained** (the table FK-checks each kind): the typed knowledge graph is **object-only** — every graph edge type requires an object target — while content-derived rows may instead resolve to a `notation_entries` row (an occurrence resolved before any definition object exists) or, for whole-work references, a `sources` row; *passage* references always flow through `source_excerpt` **objects**, keeping source grounding inside the graph.

**Edge lifecycle vs. content (generalizing the §9.y proves rule):** marker-derived edges (`from_content = true`) are *derived state*, synchronized with their markers — deleting the unit or the `Reference`/`Occurrence` marker deletes the edge. Deliberate edges anchored to units (`from_content = false` with a `source_unit_id`, e.g. a proof step's `depends_on`) are *canonical state*: deleting the anchoring unit never silently deletes them — they go **stale / to review**, removed only by the user.

### 6.1c Typed object detail is non-content metadata only

With content as flowing units (§6.0b), the typed detail tables hold **only non-content metadata**: `definition_detail.term` (the definiendum, which is object identity). Theorems, proofs, examples, questions, and notes have **no content columns** — their content is `content_units`, the mathematical force of each unit is its **`type`** (theorem/claim/conjecture/…), any hypotheses/conclusion breakdown is optional `extracted_structure`, and relationships (`proves`, `depends_on`, `uses`) are **edges**. "A theorem is a typed object, not styled prose" is expressed by *unit types + extracted structure + edges*, not by statement/hypotheses/conclusion columns — which keeps it from being rigid (§2.4).

### 6.1d Specified tagged unions — locators and selectors are never open blobs

The remaining small JSONB fields — `links.target_selector`, `links.content_locator`, `annotation_targets.anchor`, `annotation_detail.primitives` (an `AnnotationPrimitive` list), `provenance.source_locator`, `trail_steps.detail` (per-kind) — are each a **named, versioned tagged union defined in the core** and carried in the §7 schema artifact (ts-rs/specta + zod), so an implementer treating one as an open blob gets a **build error**, not a code-review comment:

```
ContentLocator  = prose_span { start, end }                       // within source_unit_id
                | expression_span { expression_id, start, end }   // stable across toggles (§6.3a)
                | whole_unit
TargetSelector  = ExpressionRef                     // FINER-than-unit refinement only; unit-level
                | StructuralPath (reserved)         //   refinement is the FK column target_unit_id —
                                                    //   never duplicated as a selector (one home)
AnchorPayload   = { selectors: [AnchorSelector] }   // §6.2 — per annotation_targets ROW; the
                                                     //   target itself lives in the row's FK columns
SourceLocator   = pdf_text   { page_index, quote/position … }
                | pdf_region { page_index, normalized_bbox }       // mirrors source-excerpt anchors
```

**Context rule — implicit vs explicit ids:** in `links`, a `ContentLocator` is paired with the `source_unit_id` column (the unit is context-supplied) and a `TargetSelector` with `target_id` (the object is context-supplied); used *outside* those pairings (e.g. inside `extracted_structure` or an anchor payload), a locator/selector must carry its `unit_id`/object id explicitly — context-dependent locators are fine, but the schema must say when context supplies the id. Every serialized value carries its variant tag plus the artifact's schema version; the core validates shape per tag (§6.1a). Flexibility is preserved — adding a variant is a core change plus an artifact bump — but "JSONB" never means "anything."

### 6.2 Anchor and placement model

An annotation carries **two distinct things**, and conflating them is a modeling error:

- **Anchor** — *what the annotation is about* (the unit, the equation, the phrase, the region). This determines correctness and never moves on its own.
- **Placement** — *where each mark appears relative to that anchor* (left margin, below the equation, a callout off to the side). This is presentation, and it is **user-movable**.

Both store **intent, not raw device pixels** (§2.1) — but with one practical nuance: *raw device pixels* are never truth, yet **normalized page/document geometry is legitimate truth for region anchors** when no better semantic selector exists. For math-heavy PDFs many anchors will start as `Region { page, normalized_bbox }`, and that is the *correct* fallback, not a failure — the team should not over-engineer semantic anchoring before shipping. Geometry that *can* be derived from a unit/text/structural selector is derived; region geometry that *is* the anchor is stored normalized (resolution-independent), and survives zoom because it's normalized rather than pixel-absolute.

**Anchor (what it's about).** Multiple selectors resolved in priority order, so it survives edits and degrades gracefully:

```
Anchor {
  target: ObjectRef                      // which object / PDF / source
  selectors: [                           // resolved in priority order
    UnitRef { unit_id }                  // a content unit ("this hypothesis") — precise, stable id
    ExpressionRef { expression_id, span? } // a math expression — stable across inline/display (§6.3a)
    TextQuote { quote, prefix, suffix }  // a phrase (editor span or PDF text layer)
    TextPosition { start, end }          // offset within the resolved target
    Region { page, normalized_bbox }     // PDF math / image region
    // RESERVED for §7 subexpression anchoring:
    StructuralPath { expression_id, term_path }  // a sub-TERM inside an expression; not used in MVP
    CellSet / ElementSet                         // composite targets, reserved
  ]
}
```

**Placement (where it appears).** Stored per mark as *relative* placement so dragging is persisted but pixels are not:

```
Placement {
  reference: AnchorRelative      // tracks the anchor box: offset (dx, dy) from it
           | MarginRelative      // pinned to a margin: side (left|right),
                                 //   vertical tied to the anchored line/row,
                                 //   horizontal offset into the margin
           | PageRelative        // rare; normalized to the page (still not raw px)
  offset:    layout-relative offset (not absolute pixels)
  // arrows / leader lines carry two endpoints, each AnchorRelative or a relative point,
  // so an arrow from a margin note to the equation re-routes as either end moves.
}
```

Each primitive kind uses placement differently: **highlight/underline** have no free placement (they sit *on* the anchored span — zero degrees of freedom); **margin note/callout** float and are freely repositionable; **ellipse/curly brace** mostly derive from the anchor with optional padding/size; **arrow** connects two endpoints — and arrows need a sharper model.

**Arrows are three different things; model them explicitly.** An arrow can be (1) a **callout** — `note → target`, one meaningful anchor plus a margin endpoint; (2) **decorative** — visual only, attached to one region; or (3) a **semantic relation** — `target A → target B`, e.g. "proof step 3 → hypothesis 2," which has *two* meaningful anchors. So an annotation carries **one or more semantic target rows** (`annotation_targets`: a structural `role` — main | from | to | member — order, the FK-checked polymorphic target, and that target's own selector payload), never fixed primary/secondary/tertiary columns — an arrow has a `from` and a `to` row, a highlight has one `main` row, a brace has several ordered `member` rows (the reserved CellSet case), and each visual primitive references the target *rows* it draws between, with per-endpoint placement. **Targets say what it is about; primitives say how it is drawn.** The important independent point: **a semantic arrow (one expressing a relation between two real targets) IS a typed link (§6 `links`) rendered with placement — the annotation carries `backing_link_id`, never its own relation field.** Relations belong in the knowledge graph — that's the single source of typed relationships, what backlinks and future dependency views read from — so a semantic arrow is rendered *from* a link (with visual placement attached), rather than duplicating relation semantics inside annotations. Callout and decorative arrows stay pure annotation primitives. *(MVP scope: ship one-anchor callout/decorative arrows; two-anchor semantic arrows and their link-backing are reserved alongside the broader anchor work, §13a slice 4.)*

**Marks are cheap; excerpts are knowledge (UX rule).** A casual PDF highlight targets the source directly (`target_source_id`: page/region) — local, free, no knowledge object minted. It **graduates** to a `source_excerpt` object the moment it grounds knowledge: when it is referenced, extracted from, linked, or annotated with substance. This keeps the graph from swallowing every underline while keeping every underline one gesture away from becoming knowledge.

**Movability — and the distinction that matters.** Two different user gestures:

- **Reposition** (drag the mark to a new spot) → updates `placement` only. The anchor — what it's about — is unchanged. This is the common case: nudge a margin note down, move it below the equation, switch margins.
- **Re-anchor** (re-attach to a different target) → updates `anchor`. A deliberate, distinct action (e.g. drag-onto-target with a modifier, or an explicit "re-attach"), so casual dragging never silently changes meaning.

On create, a mark gets a sensible **default placement** (margin notes → margin, callouts → near the anchor with a leader) that the user then adjusts. If an anchor orphans (target changed/deleted, §9), the last-known placement travels with the annotation into the Review Queue so it can be shown for reattachment.

**MVP uses `UnitRef` + `ExpressionRef` + `TextQuote` + `TextPosition` + `Region`** for anchors and `AnchorRelative` + `MarginRelative` for placement. The `StructuralPath`/composite anchor variants and `PageRelative` exist in the enums but are unused — reserving subexpression/diagram-element anchoring (§3.14, §7) as additive. *(Scope note: the MVP can ship constrained placement — margin notes that drag vertically and switch sides — and add fuller free-canvas placement later; the stored model is the same either way, so this is a UI-degrees-of-freedom choice, not a schema change.)*

### 6.3 Tri-state fields, IDs, versioning

- **Tri-state field semantics.** A field is *unset* (never given), *explicitly empty*, or *has a value*, and migrations/edits/exports must never collapse the first two into a default. This is modeled in the **core types** (e.g. an explicit presence wrapper / `Option<Option<T>>` where it matters), with nullable columns plus the convention that **migrations never backfill a default for a previously-unset field**. This is the precise meaning of "preservation of unknown fields" (§2.2) — a typing discipline, not a JSONB feature.
- **IDs.** UUIDv7, client-mintable, stable across export/import — reserving offline-create and multi-device.
- **Schema versioning & migration (§5.10).** Two levels: a SQL-structure migration tool (e.g. node-pg-migrate) for DB structure, and an **application-level `schema_version` per object** with total, non-destructive migration functions in the core. Migration tests run against **old fixtures** from day one; a previously-unset field stays unset after migration.

### 6.3a `MathExpression`: stable identity, independent of presentation

"LaTeX is canonical" is true only as an expression's *renderable surface*. And one expression often denotes *several* things — `f : X → Y` references `f`, `X`, and `Y` — so a single optional `meaning` is too small. A **`MathExpression`** — the one structure for all math, wherever it sits — holds:

```
MathExpression {
  id:             uuid            // STABLE IDENTITY — minted in content, presentation-independent
  surface_text:   string          // how the user wrote it (KaTeX renders this)
  surface_format: latex            // MVP populates `latex`; unicode | ascii | natural | mixed RESERVED
  original_input: string          // raw keystrokes, preserved even if surface is later normalized (§2.2)
  parse_status:   unresolved | renderable | partially_resolved | invalid   // is the SURFACE usable?
  occurrences:    Occurrence[]     // 0..n semantic refs inside the surface (each → an edge, §6.1b)
}
// Display mode is DERIVED from placement — inline element of prose ⇒ inline; math unit ⇒ display.
// It is NOT an independently mutable stored field (no impossible states like a "display" expression
// sitting inline). Projections may emit it for self-description; the core normalizes any incoming
// value to match placement (§6.1a).
Occurrence { selector, target: Notation | Object }   // `Symbol` RESERVED with BoundVar; MVP selector = coarse char span (Q3)
```

**Expression identity ≠ unit identity — two layers, doing different jobs.** Inline `$…$` math is a `MathExpression` *as an element of prose*; display `$$…$$` math is the same structure *wrapped by a unit* (`content.kind = math`) for block-level behavior. A display equation on its own line therefore carries **both** identities: the expression id (the mathematics) and the wrapping unit id (the block). Block-level affordances — future equation numbering, "(∗)"-style labels, "by (3.2)" references, equation-as-target annotation — attach to the **placement** (the wrapping unit); the mathematics itself is identified by the **expression**. This is why display math keeps a unit rather than being pure typography, *without* letting typography own identity.

**The toggle contract.** Toggling inline ↔ display **preserves `MathExpression.id`**; there is no mode field to flip — *the mode is the placement* — so what changes is *placement* only — pulling an expression out to display (or folding it back in) splits/merges the surrounding prose unit through the **already-specified split/merge machinery** (§6.0a), so unit ids change only via that ordinary path. In the UI this is one gesture; canonically it **composes two separate operations** — `toggle_expression_placement` (identity-preserving by this contract) and, when the surroundings require it, `split_unit`/`merge_units` (which may change unit ids, under their propagation rules) — kept separate so each guarantee is independently testable. A typography flip never mints or destroys mathematical identity. This avoids both bad extremes: every-inline-expression-a-unit (prose confetti) and presentation-determines-identity (the flaw in the earlier inline/display split).

**Binding to expressions, not positions.** Because expressions carry ids, occurrence edges and math-targeting anchors bind to **`expression_id` + a span within its surface** (§6.1b, §6.2 `ExpressionRef`) — strictly more stable than unit-relative character spans, since the binding survives both display toggles and edits to surrounding prose. Expression ids are minted in content (UUIDv7, like all ids) and are **unique workspace-wide, core-enforced on write** — which forces the copy rule: **copying content mints fresh expression ids** (otherwise one id has two homes and every `ExpressionRef`/locator turns ambiguous); *paste-as-reference* is the transclusion path — the same copy-vs-transclude choice the ownership prototype must make deliberate (§9.y). The canonical *relationships* still live in `links` rows — edges-not-blobs holds — and the **expression → unit index is an MVP derived projection**, not a someday: `ExpressionRef` anchors and occurrence locators resolve through it.

Two axes are kept distinct (the model previously conflated them): `parse_status` is about the *surface* (can it render / is it resolved), while the **unit's** `status` (§6.0) is about *authoring crystallization* (rough → user_verified). An expression can be `renderable` yet sit in a `rough` unit.

For MVP, surfaces are LaTeX rendered by KaTeX, with **coarse character-span occurrences** (Q3) — so `f : X → Y` records edges to all three targets at modest cost. The expensive part — hit-testing *sub-terms* for annotation (a parsed expression tree / MathML) — stays reserved (§6.2, §7). This keeps KaTeX practical without pretending the surface is the meaning.

### 6.3b Search projection (derived, not canonical)

Search is a **denormalized projection** (`search_documents`) rebuilt on write, never a source of truth — so fuzzy `[[ ]]` resolution and object autocomplete (§3.11, §5.8) work without a second datastore. Per object it flattens: `title`; `aliases`; `raw_source`; **plain text across all of the object's `content_units`** (prose text + claim/proof-step/derivation content — §6.0b); math **surfaces** plus notation `display`/`canonical_latex`; **source quote text** (`normalized_text` from `source_excerpt_detail`); and relationship labels. Lexical only for MVP (`tsvector` + `pg_trgm`); semantic `pgvector` search is reserved.

**Default ranking (explicit, product-tunable — the other half of "maturity controls noise," §9.y):** `trusted`/`user_verified` above `draft`; title/alias matches above body matches; objects above notation/source resolution rows; `deprecated` hidden **unless explicitly searched**; a mild recency boost, with the **active trail's context boosted** over global results. Greedy capture feels magical rather than noisy only if ranking does this work from day one. *(Later refinement: type-aware boosts — a query like `[[compactness theorem]]` should favour theorem-typed objects.)*

### 6.4 Optimistic concurrency (single-session is not single-concurrency)

Single active session removes *multi-device divergence*; it does **not** remove ordinary concurrency. Even one user has concurrent writers: two browser tabs, stale client state, slow requests racing, and — most importantly — **asynchronous jobs that finish after the user has moved on** (AI extraction, background dedup, export/import, review approvals computed against an older context). So every mutable entity carries `revision`, and:

- **Writes require `expected_revision`.** Mismatch → **409 Conflict**; the client rebases if safe, asks the user if not, or files a review item if it was AI-generated.
- **AI candidates are bound to the version they were generated from.** A candidate records `basedOn: {object_id, revision, context_snapshot_id}`. Approving a candidate that was generated against revision 7 does **not** blind-apply if the object is now revision 10 — it routes back through review against the current state. This is the concurrency-aware half of the §2.5/§3.9 trust model, and it matters *more* the larger the AI surface becomes (see §8).

**Three distinct version concepts, with explicit policies** (so a text editor doesn't snapshot on every keystroke):

- **`revision`** = the **concurrency token**. Increments on **every persisted write**; used only for optimistic-concurrency conflict detection.
- **`object_versions`** = **user-facing history checkpoints**. A snapshot is created on **meaningful save boundaries** — explicit/auto-save points and **status transitions** (e.g. draft → user-verified) — *not* on every write. (Debounced editor saves snapshot periodically, not per keystroke.)
- **`activity_events`** = **fine-grained activity** (§3.7), mostly hidden, for reconstructing recent paths.

So: `revision` gates writes, `object_versions` is the history the user can browse/restore, `activity_events` is the breadcrumb trail.

## 7. Backend / glue tier (TypeScript / Node — §17)

Fast-changing I/O around the core, in **TypeScript** (§17 decided). Responsibilities: HTTP, auth & sessions, background jobs, persistence, asset storage (R2), and request validation (which calls the core). It owns nothing canonical — it loads data, hands it to the Rust core (via napi-rs) for validation/migration/serialization, persists what comes back.

- **Framework:** a Node HTTP framework with good SSE support for AI streaming.
- **Core access:** the **Rust core as a napi-rs native addon** — TS calls in for validate/migrate/serialize/apply-operation; the FFI is a serialization boundary on those (non-hot-path) calls. Accepted per §17.
- **Persistence:** a TS query layer over the explicit schema; the Rust core does the pure transforms. (No heavy ORM; the schema is explicit and the queries are mostly direct.)
- **Migrations:** SQL-structure migrations + core migration functions (object content/payloads).
- **Jobs:** **pg-boss** (Postgres-backed) or BullMQ for extraction, export rendering, and (reserved) embeddings.
- **Auth & sessions:** a hosted IdP (Clerk/WorkOS/Auth.js) issuing JWTs verified in middleware. **Single active session per user** is enforced here as a server-side policy (issue session, invalidate prior on new login). Critically, *single-session is a policy in this tier, not an assumption in the data model* — the model stays multi-client-capable so multi-device is an additive future, not a rewrite. Residual concurrency is handled by §6.4.
- **API & type sharing — define the *artifact*.** The **Rust core emits a versioned schema package** describing `MathContent`, object detail shapes, anchors, notation entries, and review candidates; the TS glue and frontend consume it via **ts-rs/specta + generated zod validators**. Frontend/glue types are generated from the Rust core, so drift is a build error.

## 8. AI tier

Central to the product (§5.9) and likely **thin in infrastructure but not thin in behavior** — the model call is a single shot, but the surrounding behavior is where the real work concentrates: context assembly, object-aware retrieval, prompt versioning, candidate schemas, model-specific quirks, source-grounded extraction, ambiguity handling, streaming partial candidates, evals/regression, and cost control. That behavioral weight is the reason this tier deserves its own iteration story and a deliberate language choice (§17), and the reason a heavy orchestration framework is still the wrong tool: the hard part is context assembly — bespoke domain logic over the object graph that a framework would fight, not chain-of-LLM-calls plumbing.

It lives *in* the glue tier — so its language **is TypeScript (§17, decided)**, with the integrity core staying Rust (reached via napi-rs). It is *not* a separate service and *not* Python on the request path; it calls *into* the core to read/validate canonical data, and is never part of the core (opposite stability and purity profiles). It stays unified with the glue precisely because context assembly is coupled to the object graph and must not be severed from the model call. (Python remains available *offline* for eval harnesses; it is not on the request path.)

**A larger AI surface strengthens, not weakens, two existing decisions.** The bigger and more experimental the AI tier becomes, (a) the more valuable the hard **core ↔ AI seam** is — you want a large, churning, non-deterministic surface kept firmly out of trusted canonical storage (§2.5), which is exactly what the seam guarantees; and (b) the more the **version-bound candidate** rule (§6.4) matters — more candidates generated against state that may have moved before approval.

- **Provider interface.** A `LlmProvider` trait abstracts the model vendor. This is the single seam that reserves **BYOK and BYO-endpoint** (§17 reservation) — adding "use the user's key/endpoint" later is implementing behind this trait, touching no workflow code. API keys are server-side only; user-supplied keys (future) are treated as an **encrypted-secret category**, never logged, never echoed to the client, never written into context snapshots.
- **Context assembler.** Plain domain logic that gathers the relevant context — current selection, current object, current trail, linked definitions, source excerpts, user notes — into a snapshot. This snapshot is **stored** so §3.15 "inspect what context the AI used" is just rendering it. (Retrieval here is *graph-aware* — follow links, pull the linked definition, walk the trail — not generic top-k vector similarity, which is another reason off-the-shelf RAG plumbing is a poor fit.)
- **Workflow = (context recipe, prompt template + version, output schema).** Each workflow is one such triple over shared machinery.
- **MVP workflow set — start with a few, not eleven.** Although §5.9 lists eleven as the MVP *target*, eleven multiplies prompt/version/eval/review/concurrency complexity before the machinery is proven. Build first: **(1) extract object candidate from a source/editor selection, (2) polish a rough object, (3) suggest links/duplicates, (4) suggest structure** — propose `type`s for untyped units ("this paragraph reads like *motivation*; this sentence like a *theorem*") and decompositions (`extracted_structure`: hypotheses/conclusion) — the semantic half of the authoring workflow (§9.y). All **propose into the Review Queue / as inline suggestions; never silently impose** (the user's own labels are authoritative, §9.y). Then expand toward the full set.
- **Structured outputs, not prose.** Every workflow returns a serde/JSON-schema-validated **typed candidate** — e.g. a structure suggestion as `{ unit_id, suggested_type, extracted_structure?, confidence }`, or an extracted object as a typed-unit set — bound to its source version (§6.4), flowing into the **Review Queue** stamped with model id, prompt-template id+version, and context snapshot. On acceptance a suggestion **materializes** — a `type` on the unit; units/`links` where the structure corresponds to real elements; or confirmed `extracted_structure` (documented schema) for sub-unit spans — never an accreting parallel truth (§6.0). the unit enters or updates with `declared_by = user` and **AI provenance + derivation** (authority ≠ origin, §6.0). This operationalizes the §3.9 rule: *if the system generated it, it goes to Review* — never silently into user-authored knowledge.
- **Streaming.** Responses stream to the client via SSE; the Review Queue handles partial/streamed candidates gracefully.
- **Rate, cost, abuse.** Per-user rate limiting and quotas and provider-key protection are built early (cheap now, expensive to retrofit), since AI is server-mediated.

## 9. Frontend (TypeScript, web only)

A client-side workspace. Shell: **React + Vite + TanStack Router + TanStack Query** (server cache) + **Zustand** (local UI/editor state). Canonical types are generated from the core (§7).

**Editor (the heart) — ProseMirror via TipTap, editing a *projection* of `MathContent`.** The editor and its node types are an adapter (§6.0); on save, the projection maps back to `MathContent` and meaning-changing edits go through canonical operations (§6.0a).
- Editor node types (the editor's vocabulary, not the core's): theorem / definition / proof / example regions, inline/display math (whose *surface* is LaTeX, rendered by KaTeX — the *meaning* lives in the `Expression`, §6.3a), object/notation/source references, and annotation-anchor marks.
- `;` **snippets** via input rules are the *input shortcut*; what they insert resolves against the **notation registry** (§6) so accepted notations become semantic references, not bare LaTeX (§6.3a). A user-editable, scope-aware snippet dictionary backs this (§5.6).
- `[[ ]]` **object search** and `/` **commands** via TipTap's Suggestion utility; candidate sources, snippet scope, and notation scope are all driven by the current **input environment** (§9.x) — completion inside a theorem differs from inside a note or a source-note.
- **Type cues / slash menu** issue canonical operations (§6.0a): a leading word (`Thm.`, `Idea:`), `/command`, or select-then-mark sets a unit's `type` — the central authoring workflow (§9.y). Routine in the editor, meaning-changing in the core.
- Rough input is never punished (§5.1): malformed LaTeX and informal references are preserved as `rough` units (§6.0); clean-up is offered, not forced.
- *(Note: the "different input modality per environment" / CodeMirror-NodeView pattern is for computational cells, which are out of MVP scope — reserved. The environment **abstraction** itself, §9.x, is needed now.)*

### 9.x Input environments (a platform-level system, not just frontend behavior)

The editor's context-sensitivity is modeled explicitly as **InputEnvironment**, not left as a pile of ad-hoc TipTap plugins. An environment is a named bundle of rules that a block (a theorem, a proof, a source-note) instantiates, and it spans layers: defined once in a shared **environment registry** (config in the core/shared layer), enforced by the editor during input, and consumed by the backend for projection and AI-context.

```
InputEnvironment {
  id
  allowed_blocks / allowed_inline_nodes
  autocomplete_providers      // which candidate sources fire here
  notation_scope              // which notation entries / conventions apply (§6)
  normalization_rules
  toolbar_actions
  validation_rules
  ai_actions                  // which §8 workflows are offered in this context
  projection_rules            // how this env maps into MathContent / export / AI context
}
```

Examples (MVP): a **Theorem** environment autocompletes prior definitions/theorems, supports hypothesis/conclusion structure, offers the "polish theorem statement" AI action; a **Proof** environment autocompletes assumptions and theorem refs, supports step/dependency links, offers "find hidden assumptions"; a **Source-note** environment autocompletes source/object refs and preserves the source anchor. **MVP scope guardrail:** environments are a *platform-internal* abstraction with a small fixed set (note, definition, theorem, proof, source-note). A *user-definable* environment editor is a §6 non-goal ("user-defined workflow editor"), explicitly out of scope — the abstraction is for internal structure, not a configuration surface.

### 9.y How structure gets set — the central authoring workflow

This is **the single most important workflow in the MVP**, and the whole content model (§6.0) exists to serve it. The governing constraint: **typing is never interrupted to classify.** Structure is never a *precondition* of writing — only ever something layered onto writing that already exists, or declared in the same keystrokes as the writing. There are three sources of structure, in descending order of how often they fire, and a strict priority among them:

**1. User-declared — deterministic, authoritative, primary.** The user assigns a unit's `type` with one gesture, and the dominant gesture is the one mathematicians already use: a **leading cue while typing**. Typing `Thm.`, `Def:`, `Q:`, `Idea:`, `Claim:` at the start of a line *makes* that unit that type — the way Markdown turns `#` into a heading, with no menu and no selection. Secondary gestures, for content already written: **select-then-mark** (highlight a sentence → "Intuition") and a **slash command** (`/conjecture`). All three set the *same one field* (`type`); the user never picks a shape or fills fields. A relational cue expands atomically: `Counterexample:` creates the unit *and* opens the `counterexample_to` target picker — still one act (§6.0b). `declared_by = user` here, and it is **authoritative**: nothing downstream silently overrides it. One subtlety matters for trust: the machinery that *recognizes* a leading cue is the same deterministic parser as source 2 — but **recognition is not authorship**. A cue is **user-declared-via-syntax** (`declared_by = user`, never `deterministic`); the parser is the messenger, the user is the author of the classification — which is what entitles cue-declared types to materialize (§ below) while parser-inferred *forms* never do.

**2. Deterministic inference — silent, instant, syntactic.** Anything with a *syntactic signature* is inferred by a deterministic program — no LLM, because this fires on the keystroke path and must be instant and predictable: paragraph/line boundaries → unit boundaries; `$$…$$` → a `math` unit (display) and `$…$` → an inline math element in prose — both wrapping a `MathExpression` whose **id is presentation-independent**, so toggling inline↔display is a placement change, never an identity change (§6.3a); an aligned `=`/`≤`/`⇒` chain → a `derivation`; `[[…]]` → a reference edge; `;NN` → notation; "Case 1: … Case 2: …" → a `case_split`. Crucially, **`content.kind` is always inferred here, never chosen** — the authored material's syntax fixes the form immediately (*shape-now*); the declared `type` may *inform* inference in ambiguous cases but never determines the kind (a theorem may be prose, a display expression, or a group of parts). `declared_by = deterministic`.

**The deterministic layer never sets a `type` (user decision).** Everything above sets *form, references, or notation* — punctuation heuristics are deliberately excluded from the MVP: a line ending in `?` is **just prose** until the user cues it (`Q:` / `Question.` / `/question` / select-then-mark) or accepts an LLM suggestion. So the rule is exact: **only explicit user cues create authoritative unit types**; heuristic type-guessing belongs to the suggestion beat (source 3), never the keystroke path. Since auto-materialization triggers on *declared* types (below), this also means a stray `?` can never mint a graph object — `declared_by = deterministic` marks form/reference declarations, not types.

**User-typed markup (Markdown-style), and where it lands.** The user writes with the ordinary affordances — directly, like Obsidian, by typing markup (or via toolbar/shortcut): `$…$`/`$$…$$` for math, `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `` `code` ``, `-`/`1.` lists, `#` headings, `> ` quotes, `[[links]]`, `;` notation. This is all the deterministic layer, and the only subtlety — which an implementer hits on day one — is that the *same keystrokes sort into three different bins in the model*:

- **Model constructs (durable)** — `$…$` creates an **inline math element inside prose**, `$$…$$` a **`math` unit** (display); both carry the *same* `MathExpression` structure with a presentation-independent id (§6.3a) — inline-vs-display is *placement*, not meaning, which is why this bin is named for the model, not for "semantics". `-`/`1.` create **list content** (`content.kind = list`; items as child rows). Real model constructs, not styling.
- **Inline presentational marks** — `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `#` headings, `` `code` ``, `>` quotes are *formatting inside a unit's prose content* (`prose.marks`), stored as lightweight inline marks in the specified content format (the one legitimate place editor-style "marks" live — *inside* prose, never as a unit-level concept). The core preserves them but treats them as opaque styling, not meaning. A heading is **not** a `type`: "heading" isn't a math-flow role like *theorem* or *motivation*; it's prose formatting. *(Reserved refinement: in long structured notes, headings may later be promoted to titled `group` units — real section semantics, an additive change since `group` already exists. For MVP they remain presentational.)*
- **References / notation** — `[[…]]` resolves to an edge (§6.1b), `;NN` to a notation entry (§6).

This is why the model holds up: **markup that is presentational rides inside prose (and may not survive a format change); model-level markup (`$$`, lists) and the unit's `type` are the durable layer** that export to LaTeX/Typst must preserve. The unifying UX point is that the leading-marker reflex is *one* muscle — `#` → heading (presentational) and `Thm.` → a `type` (semantic) feel identical to type, even though they land in different bins. So the user gets one fluid markup-driven editor; the model files each keystroke where it belongs. (`type` remains the orthogonal axis of §9.y-source-1 — you never get *intuition* or *theorem* from a markup character.)

**3. LLM-proposed — semantic, on a beat, never imposed.** Structure with *no* syntactic tell — "this paragraph is *motivation*", "this is the key *idea*", "these three lines are a *proof sketch*", "the hypotheses are X and Y, the conclusion is Z" — requires understanding, so it is the LLM's job (§8 workflow 4). Under three hard constraints from the trust model (§2.5/§3.9): it runs **on an explicit beat** (on demand, or at "promote this note" — *not* per keystroke, to avoid a "possessed editor"); it **proposes** (Review Queue / inline `[Accept] [Edit] [Ignore]`), never silently rewriting; and a proposal is **one-gesture** to accept or dismiss. *Decomposition is the deferred half* — `extracted_structure` (hypotheses/conclusion) is proposed here, after the fact (*decomposition-later*). An AI proposal is never a canonical unit: it lives in `review_items`; on acceptance the structure enters with `declared_by = user` and provenance recording the AI origin and derivation — **authority and origin are two facts in two homes**.

**The priority is strict:** user-declared > deterministic > LLM-suggested. The LLM never overrides a user's label; deterministic inference yields to an explicit user type. And the three degrade gracefully into each other — if the user doesn't cue it (1) and it has no syntactic tell (2), it sits as `rough` prose until the LLM offers something (3) or nobody ever bothers, **and that is a valid terminal state** (§2.2).

**Structure must be as easy to remove and change as to add** — otherwise people stop adding it. The affordances come in inverse pairs: a cue/slash sets a type, **one click clears it** (back to plain content, history kept in versions); re-typing a leading word changes the type; the LLM proposes, a dismiss rejects it for good. Splitting a unit splits it into stable-id children with defined propagation of type/annotations/provenance; merging is its inverse (§6.0a). This is what "progressive, local, reversible" means *in the hands*.

**What the user sees.** A normal flowing document — never "fields." Types render as **light affordances** (a gutter label, a subtle tint), not boxes: a theorem with tagged hypotheses still reads and edits as flowing text. Editing is **edit-in-place / WYSIWYG with progressive disclosure** — you see the rendered theorem; click a rendered expression and its LaTeX surface opens. Presentation and editing can't drift because they are two projections of the *same* units (§6.0) — there is no separate rendered copy.

**Fluid object identity, history in the log.** Because structure is reversible, the user **mutates objects freely** — a question companion to a theorem, a note that becomes three objects, a label removed. Prior states are **not** kept lingering in the workspace (that would violate the calm-desk principle, §5.11); they are recoverable from `object_versions` + provenance (§6.4). So §2.2 ("never lose effort") is met by the *log*, not by cluttering the live surface — the user stays in control of their material.

**Object boundaries do not leak into the default UI — and materialization is greedy, with staged maturity.** The model distinguishes units inside a flow from standalone objects joined by edges (§6.0b) — but that is the *system's* bookkeeping, and the §3.18 principle applies inward: **the UI is an adapter over the canonical model, including over object boundaries. The UI presents a continuous mathematical document; internal object boundaries may differ from visual boundaries, as long as editing remains smooth, predictable, and reversible.** The user writes "Theorem. … Proof. …" as one document and is never asked "promote this to an object?"

Underneath, the policy is **greedy capture, staged maturity** *(revising an earlier lazy-objectification position — lazy keeps the workspace tidy by leaving the graph empty exactly where the product's value lives: `[[ ]]` resolution, backlinks, search, and dedup all operate over objects, so a lazy theorem is undiscoverable)*. The governing principle:

> **User-declared formal knowledge units materialize by default. Discourse units remain local by default, but *any* unit can be materialized by explicit user action. AI may *suggest* materialization, but user acceptance is required. Graph visibility is controlled by status, type, and filters — not by preventing object creation.**

Three categories, with the user sovereign over all of them:

- **Auto-materialized on declaration.** Declaring `theorem` / `lemma` / `proposition` / `corollary` / `definition` / `conjecture` / `question` / `proof` / `example` creates a **draft object** immediately and silently (`source_excerpt` is an object by construction) — where *declaring* means an **explicit cue** (leading keyword, slash, select-then-mark), never a punctuation heuristic (user decision, source 2 above). `question` is deliberately included: in a learning platform, questions are knowledge artifacts, not mere discourse — the volume of small question nodes is a *filtering* problem, not an identity problem. The graph sees the object *now* — `[[ ]]` autocomplete, backlinks, search, dedup — and **maturity, not absence, controls noise**: the existing lifecycle (`draft → user_verified → trusted`, `deprecated`) is the filter, no new status machinery, with search/autocomplete ranking accepted above draft (and the future map UI, a §6 non-goal for MVP, filtering on the same axis). Because questions auto-materialize, **verify early that draft-question volume stays navigable** — `status` + user tags ("central", "return") are the MVP filter; a dedicated importance field stays reserved until evidence demands it.
- **Local by default, materializable on demand.** `motivation`/`intuition`/`idea`/`proof_idea`/`remark`/`warning`/`analogy`/`application`/`note` — and `open_issue`/`return_later`, which the return surface reads as units — stay units attached to what they sit beside. **But the user remains sovereign:** a profound intuition or a load-bearing idea can be elevated to a graph object with one action. (`application` stays local by default precisely because it is ambiguous between discourse and durable artifact — but it is a *strong* Add-to-graph candidate, typically materializing as an `example`/`note` object with an `application_of` edge — and a watch-item: if usage shows people expect *Application* to be graph-visible by default, the default moves on evidence, not principle. A counterexample materializes as an `example` object + `counterexample_to` edge.)
- **AI-suggested materialization.** The LLM may propose *"this question seems central — add it to the graph?"* (a §8 suggestion kind), but an AI never silently creates objects: a candidate is a `review_item`, not an object (§3.9), structurally outside the graph until accepted — no special status needed.

**The storage contract: product rule binding, mechanism prototyped.** The binding rule is — **a materialized object remains editable exactly where the user wrote it**: same flow, no visible boundary, no editing discontinuity. *How* ownership is stored is settled by an **early prototype of seamless inline object editing** (§13a slice 2), not finalized here. The prototype's pass bar is wider than typing: **copy/paste, undo/redo, export, backlinks, object version history, delete/dissolution, and tag propagation** must all behave — these are where hidden ownership problems surface (a local idea tagged "central" must keep its tag through materialization). Each is a pass/fail question: can a theorem declared inside a note become graph-backed with zero change to the visual flow? can the declaration be undone cleanly? can undo/redo cross a materialized boundary? can the user copy that theorem to another note **without accidentally duplicating identity** (copy-vs-transclude must be a deliberate choice)? does the object's version history stay coherent when all edits arrive via the host note? can export reconstruct the visual flow *and* export the object? does dissolution explain its references? **If this prototype fails, greedy capture itself gets revisited — so it runs as the first deliverable of slice 2, before anything depends on it.** The prototype should also test, *as an open question*, a subtle optional "graph-backed" affordance on embedded materialized objects (a collapse/expand or faint badge): does it aid orientation or harm calm editing? The default remains boundary-invisible either way. The candidates, with the evaluation criteria named: **re-homing** the declared unit subtree into the new object *(the lean: one content model, the object owns its own version history, exports cleanly — but it is a heavy invariant: silent content movement behind an invisible embed)* versus a **stable origin reference** *(lighter at declaration, but introduces a by-reference content mode and muddies whose `object_versions` hold the content)*. The product contract binds either way.

- **Reversibility — dissolution as a reviewable operation.** Clearing the type on a materialized unit dissolves the draft object back into local units **if nothing depends on its identity**. If inbound links, annotations, or review items reference it, dissolution becomes a **reviewable operation, not a silent failure**: the UI shows *what* references it ("referenced in 3 places: …") and offers deprecate / keep / detach. Materialization and dissolution are both recorded in provenance.

**Materialization includes the obvious edge.** "Proof." immediately following a theorem-like unit in the same flow materializes the proof object **and deterministically adds its `proves` edge to that theorem** — adjacency is a syntactic cue, owned by the deterministic layer (source 2) under the same priority rules (user's explicit cue — "Proof of [[X]]." — is authoritative; the deterministic edge is detachable). The rule, narrowly: a proof unit immediately following **exactly one** unambiguous theorem-like unit (`theorem` / `lemma` / `proposition` / `corollary` / `claim`) in the same local flow → deterministic edge; any ambiguity → a *review suggestion*, never a silent guess; a proof following a **`conjecture`** also routes to review — proving a conjecture is a notable event (it usually wants a re-type to theorem), worth a beat rather than a silent edge. *(Reserved nicety: re-typing a conjecture to a theorem can prompt revisiting nearby proofs and pending `proves` suggestions.)* And the cue governs **creation only**: once created, the edge is ordinary canonical state — if the user later moves the proof elsewhere, the system **never silently deletes** the `proves` edge; it persists until the user removes it, or is marked **stale** / flagged for review when its structural basis has vanished (the same staleness machinery as everywhere else). An auto-materialized proof must not enter the graph missing its most important edge — and must not lose it to a reordering.

**Edge-driven materialization (closes a gap the v15 rule opened):** graph edges target objects only (§6.1b) — so when an edge is created at a *local* typed unit, that unit **materializes at edge time**: the edge is the first action needing identity, and this is the general principle behind every non-declaration path into the graph. **The trigger is narrow:** only **canonical** edges — deliberate user edges or deterministic relation edges — that require object identity materialize anything. Content-derived markers never do (structurally they *cannot* target local units: `[[ ]]` and occurrences resolve to objects/notation/sources or stay unresolved, §6.1b), and AI-*suggested* edges materialize only at acceptance — acceptance is what makes them canonical. Concretely: a deterministic `proves` arriving at a local `claim` (which deliberately does *not* auto-materialize on declaration) materializes the claim then — justified by the two explicit acts that preceded it (`Claim:` then `Proof.`), recorded in provenance, dissolvable as usual. **Claim's lifecycle, as product reasoning:** `claim` is local by default because many claims are *proof-internal*; it earns identity when proved, reused, edge-targeted, or explicitly added to the graph — proof-internal claims should not all become top-level graph objects, but a claim with a proof deserves a node. *Greedy capture covers declaration time; edge-driven materialization covers everything after.*

**Worked examples (canonical):**
- *Note → theorem.* A note contains "Thm. Every compact metric space is complete." Declaring `Thm.` materializes a draft theorem object; the note still shows and edits the theorem inline (the storage contract); `[[ ]]` finds it immediately; `unit.type = theorem` and the new `object.type = theorem` are different layers (§6.0b).
- *Theorem + proof.* "Proof." on the next line materializes a proof object **with** `proves → that theorem` (adjacency rule above) — graph-complete from the first keystrokes.
- *Dissolution with inbound references.* Un-typing a materialized theorem that two notes link to neither silently fails nor silently dissolves — it opens the reviewable dissolution flow: shows the two references, offers deprecate / keep / detach.

Natural actions — *Add another proof · Reuse this proof · Link this proof to another theorem · Show dependencies · Extract as a separate note · **Add to graph** · **Track this** · **Make reusable*** — *compile to* the canonical operation `materialize_object` + edges (§6.0a). **The operation name is core vocabulary only:** the UI never says "materialize" or "promote" — it says *Add to graph* or *Track this*. (The same adapter rule as everywhere else: internal vocabulary never leaks into the surface.)

**Math — KaTeX (renders the surface), meaning via refs.** Synchronous, fast, sufficient for MVP rendering and annotation. An `Expression` (§6.0/§6.3a) holds a **surface** (LaTeX, what KaTeX renders) *plus* an optional **meaning** where the user accepted notation/object resolution — so "LaTeX is canonical" means the renderable *surface*, not the *meaning*. *Reserved:* a parsed expression tree and a MathML-producing renderer (MathJax/Temml) for subexpression hit-testing, when equation-subexpression anchoring (§7) arrives.

**PDF — PDF.js as the substrate.** PDF.js is the substrate; **react-pdf is used only if it does not obstruct** the control the anchor/overlay engine needs — text-layer spans, viewport transforms, selection rects, scroll/zoom sync, overlay coordinate systems, page lifecycle, render timing. Because that engine is too important to hide behind a wrapper that fights it, the plan is to **prototype both** (react-pdf wrapper vs. direct PDF.js viewer) early and be ready to drop to direct PDF.js. Capabilities: text/region selection, highlight, **multi-selector anchors** (§6.2), reading-position memory, margin notes, and an "extract candidate" action routing a version-bound typed candidate to the **Review Queue**. The PDF is just another addressable place (§3.6), not a separate app.

**Annotations — overlay + decorations.** Free-floating primitives (highlight, margin note, callout, ellipse, curly brace, arrow, underline — §3.14) render on an **SVG overlay** whose geometry is computed from **anchor + placement** (§6.2) and recomputed on edit/scroll/zoom (ProseMirror transactions + ResizeObserver). In-flow marks (highlight/underline) ride as **ProseMirror decorations** / PDF text-layer overlays. The shared engine is the **anchor resolver** (anchor + placement + current layout → geometry), feeding both. **The user can move marks:** dragging a margin note (down, below the equation, to the other margin, off to the side as a callout) updates its stored *relative placement* and re-derives geometry — so it persists and survives reflow without ever storing pixels; **re-attaching** to a different target is a separate, deliberate gesture that changes the *anchor*, so casual dragging never silently changes what a note is about. **Graceful degradation:** when a mutable target changed and an anchor can't fully resolve, the annotation is surfaced as **orphaned** in the Review Queue (`orphaned_annotation`) — content and last-known placement preserved, attachment flagged honestly — never silently misplaced. PDF/immutable targets never reach this path. (MVP anchors are block/span/region; subexpression is reserved.)

**Diagrams — reserved, not in the MVP (§14).** No SVG renderer, direct-manipulation editor, NL diagram authoring, or TikZ codegen is built for the MVP. The diagram object type and a structured diagram model are *reserved* in the canonical model so adding them later is additive (the "structured data, not pixels" thesis, §3.13, is preserved for when it lands).

**Home — calm desk (§5.11).** Continue-where-you-left-off, active trails, Inbox, Review Queue, return-later items, recent sources, recent notes. Not a graph dashboard.

## 10. Export, import, and migration

This layer *proves* the architecture: if the canonical model is clean, the *projections* are pure functions over it (§3.17 — "not a late feature"). But a `.mathpack` is a zip with assets, which is I/O — so the responsibility splits, and the purity claim is scoped honestly:

- **Core (pure):** build/serialize the export **manifest** and the canonical-graph JSON; **validate** an import manifest; **migrate** imported objects; compute **expected asset references** (content hashes); the deterministic **readable projections** (`MathContent` → Markdown/HTML, and reserved Typst/LaTeX). These are pure functions and are property-tested.
- **Glue (I/O):** zip/unzip; read/write/stream **assets** to and from R2; verify content hashes against the manifest's expected references; stream large PDFs; HTTP response streaming. None of this is in the core.

So `.mathpack` is *assembled* by the glue (zip + asset streaming) around a *deterministic manifest + serialization* produced by the core.

- **`.mathpack` contents** = a `manifest.json` + the canonical-graph JSON + an `assets/` folder (PDFs, images, content-hashed for dedup). A minimal manifest, fixed now so export/import property tests are concrete (fields may evolve, the integrity story may not):

```json
{
  "format": "mathpack",
  "format_version": 1,
  "schema_version": 1,
  "created_at": "…",
  "space": { "id": "…" },
  "counts": { "objects": 0, "links": 0, "sources": 0, "assets": 0 },
  "assets": [ { "key": "sha256:…", "media_type": "application/pdf", "bytes": 0 } ],
  "checksums": { "graph_json": "sha256:…" }
}
```
  The graph JSON carries objects, edges/references, aliases, annotations, trails, **notation entries + conventions**, provenance, and per-object schema versions; Inbox/Review states where appropriate. (Diagrams: reserved, §14.) Assets are referenced by content hash; the manifest's `checksums` + `assets` give a clear integrity/migration story.
- **Readable export (MVP):** `MathContent` → **Markdown** and **HTML**. *Reserved:* Typst (primary future PDF path), emitted LaTeX, BibTeX/RIS, and **Pandoc** strictly as a conversion bridge — added as more projections, never as the canonical backend.
- **Tests (mandatory, §5.10).** Round-trip `serialize → deserialize` and `export → import` as **proptest** invariants in the core (over the pure manifest/serialization), plus migration tests against old fixtures, plus an integration test that exercises the glue's zip+asset round-trip. These guard the §2.2 "no lost user effort" promise — not optional polish.

## 11. (intentionally folded into §5–§10)

## 12. Sync, sessions, and offline posture

- **Server-authoritative with local read cache.** The server is the single source of truth; the client caches for speed and read-resilience.
- **Single active session per user (MVP).** This eliminates *multi-device divergence* — a cleaner simplification than a conflict policy, and it avoids the §2.2-violating "last-write-wins silently drops an edit" trap. Enforced at the session layer (§7), absent from the data model. **It does not, however, eliminate ordinary concurrency:** two tabs, stale client state, racing requests, and asynchronous jobs (AI, dedup, export, review approvals against older state) are all still concurrent writers. That residual concurrency is handled by **optimistic concurrency control (§6.4)** — `revision` + `expected_revision` on writes, 409 on mismatch, and version-bound AI candidates. (Correcting an earlier overstatement: single-session removes the *merge* problem, not the *concurrency* problem.)
- **Offline:** the MVP is an **online web app**; offline editing is out of scope (and native apps are a §6 non-goal). The pieces that would make offline cheap later — client-mintable IDs, append-friendly writes, the core compiling to WASM — are reserved, so offline/multi-device is additive.

**Reserved (not built):** CRDT convergence (ProseMirror→Yjs is the path), a sync-relay service, and offline-create. The rule to hold so these stay additive: never bake "the server is the only writer" or "there is exactly one client" into the canonical model.

**Stated precisely, to prevent confusion:** the MVP is **online-first and server-authoritative**. It is **portability-first / export-first** — data sovereignty comes via `.mathpack`, client-mintable IDs, and a future WASM-core path — but it is **not local-first at runtime**. Client-mintable IDs + "WASM later" *enable* local-first; they do not *make the MVP* local-first. Full local-first/offline editing is reserved by design, not delivered.

---

## 13. Hard builds and honest risk

This is a **large MVP** — worth stating plainly for planning. The genuinely hard builds, in rough order of design risk:

1. **The editor + environment system** — ProseMirror editing a projection of `MathContent`, the **InputEnvironment** abstraction (§9.x) driving scope-aware autocomplete, snippet input rules resolving against the **notation registry** (§6), canonical operations on save, and annotation-anchor marks. The framework provides the engines; the projection, environment/notation/context-routing logic, and popup UI are real work.
2. **PDF + the anchor layer** — multi-selector anchors with graceful degradation are real engineering; raw PDF offsets are fragile, hence the multi-strategy model. (Prototype react-pdf vs. direct PDF.js early — §9.)
3. **The annotation overlay engine** — the anchor resolver + SVG overlay + decorations, shared between editor and PDF. This is where the "not just screen coordinates" promise (§2.1) is kept or quietly broken; get the resolver right early.
4. **The AI tier** — thin in infra, heavy in behavior (§8); **three workflows first**, each a context-recipe/template/schema triple routing version-bound candidates through the Review Queue with provenance, then expand toward the eleven.

*(Diagrams were a fifth hard build in earlier drafts; cutting them from the MVP — §14 — removes a whole rendering/codegen workstream and is a deliberate scope reduction.)*

Builds 2 and 3 share the anchor model — which is why pinning the anchor model down early matters more than any single library choice. The integrity core should be the **first thing to stabilize** (it's the bet, and the part most worth crystallizing); the workflows and UI churn around it.

### 13a. Vertical-slice build sequence

The MVP is large, so build it as **thin vertical slices** that each prove part of the core loop end-to-end, rather than completing layers horizontally. Recommended order:

1. **Canonical object core** — `objects` + `content_units` + edges + detail + `provenance` + `object_versions` + `revision`; the first `MathContent` spec/serializer + unit-level canonical operations; the `.mathpack` manifest + serialization; migration fixtures. No fancy editor yet. *(Crystallize the integrity core here.)*
2. **Editor object loop + the authoring workflow (§9.y)** — create note/definition/theorem/example; rough input preserved as `rough` units; **`type`-tagging via leading cues / slash / select-then-mark**, deterministic shape inference, **greedy materialization of object-worthy types (+ reviewable dissolution)**, **seamless inline editing of materialized objects (the re-homing vs origin-reference decision is made here, §9.y)**, **the inline↔display toggle preserving expression identity (§6.3a)**, and the split/merge propagation rules (prototype and try to break these early — this is the make-or-break surface; the ownership prototype must pass copy/paste, undo/redo, export, backlinks, version history, and dissolution, §9.y); KaTeX surface rendering; references/occurrences-as-edges; snippet/notation MVP; status; an export/import round-trip that passes. *(LLM structure suggestions come in slice 5.)* *Heavy AI and PDF-annotation work deliberately wait behind this slice's ownership gate — nothing feature-rich gets built on an unproven editing contract.*
3. **Source grounding** — PDF upload/view; text selection; source-excerpt object; PDF anchor; extract-candidate → Review Queue; approve a candidate into an object.
4. **Annotation MVP** — text highlight; PDF highlight; margin note; `UnitRef` anchors ("this hypothesis"); ellipse/arrow *only once the anchor model holds*; orphaned-annotation review.
5. **AI workflows (the three)** — extract from selection; polish a rough object; suggest links/duplicates. Then expand toward the broader set.

This keeps the **read/write → object → source-linked → annotated → reviewed → exported** loop validated at every step while holding the largest risks (the `MathContent` model, the anchor model, AI iteration) where they can be managed. *(Diagrams are not in this sequence — reserved, §14.)*

---

## 14. Reserved futures (doors held open at near-zero cost)

Each is an *extension, not a rewrite* (§7), because of a specific cheap reservation made now:

- **Computational pillar (§3.16):** object families + relationship types reserved as a *namespace* (the object families added to the core enum only when their minimal schema is known; relationship-type names reserved now); *everything else* — generator registry, client GPU runtime (WebGPU/WebGL), Lenia-class systems — is future. (Such compute is a **client GPU** concern, orthogonal to the backend language; it never argued for or against Rust here.)
- **Diagrams:** a `diagram` object type + a structured diagram model are reserved (no renderer, editor, NL authoring, or TikZ codegen in the MVP). Adding them is additive — a new object type with detail + projections — touching neither `MathContent` nor the graph. (Cut from the MVP to shrink scope; the "structured data, not pixels" thesis, §3.13, is preserved for when it lands.)
- **Multi-device + sync:** client-mintable UUIDv7 + append-friendly writes + core-compiles-to-WASM; CRDT/Yjs + sync relay are future.
- **Native apps:** **desktop via Tauri** is the likely first native shell and is relatively plausible (it wraps the same web frontend). **Mobile/tablet is reserved but is *not* cheap** — even as a Capacitor/RN WebView shell it likely needs substantial surface *redesign*, because ProseMirror mobile behavior, PDF annotation gestures, pen/stylus support, the loss of hover/keyboard shortcuts, and tight layout constraints all make the editor/PDF/annotation interactions a real product surface, not a reflow. The WASM core makes client-side *integrity* portable; it does nothing for the *interaction* redesign. (True per-platform native UI remains explicitly out — it would mean rebuilding those surfaces per platform.)
- **Subexpression & diagram-element anchoring:** the `StructuralPath`/composite selector variants + a parsed expression tree; the MathML rendering upgrade is future.
- **BYOK / BYO-endpoint:** the `LlmProvider` interface + encrypted-secret handling + open-ended provenance `model` field.
- **Richer export (Typst/LaTeX/PDF) + Pandoc bridge:** added `MathContent` projections over the same canonical model.
- **Collaboration:** the ProseMirror→Yjs path.

The standing test for all of these: *could this be added behind an existing boundary without touching the canonical model, the provenance schema, or unrelated code?* If yes, the reservation is correct.

---

## 15. Infrastructure & ops

- **Database:** managed Postgres (Neon — `pgvector` support + branch-per-migration; Supabase if bundled auth/storage is wanted).
- **Assets:** Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible), content-hashed; zero egress for repeatedly served PDFs.
- **Hosting:** the **Node server (with the Rust core as a native napi-rs addon)** as a long-running **container** (Fly.io / Railway). A container (not serverless) matters because export will later shell out to Typst/Pandoc, and binary deps (the Rust addon, CLI tools) + cold starts make serverless a trap for this workload.
- **Auth:** hosted IdP, JWT verified in-process.
- **Observability:** structured logs + Sentry.

---

## 16. Testing strategy

- **Core (Rust):** unit tests + **proptest** invariants — the serialize/deserialize round-trip, the export/import round-trip, and migration totality. These are the heart of the §2.2 guarantee.
- **Migration suite:** old fixtures migrated forward, asserting non-destructiveness and tri-state preservation.
- **Glue/API:** integration tests against a real Postgres.
- **Frontend:** **Playwright** e2e on the editor, PDF, and annotation flows (the surfaces most likely to regress subtly).

---

## 17. Decided: TypeScript glue/AI tier + Rust core (via napi-rs)

The earlier spike question is **resolved**: the **glue + AI tier is TypeScript (Node)**, the **integrity core stays Rust**, and the two meet at an **in-process napi-rs FFI**. The decision is driven by the AI tier being heavy in *behavior* (§8) — the mature TS LLM/streaming/eval ecosystem and a single language shared with the frontend outweigh the cost of the FFI seam.

**The accepted tradeoff, stated plainly:**
- **Gained:** the TS LLM ecosystem (streaming-to-React, structured-output libraries, richer eval tooling) and faster iteration on experimental AI workflows; one language across glue and frontend; easy type-sharing into the frontend.
- **Paid:** a **napi-rs FFI boundary** at the core edge (a serialization boundary on validate/migrate/serialize/apply-operation calls — acceptable, since these are not hot-path) and a **two-toolchain build** (Rust core + TS). This is the same "load-bearing, slow-changing boundary" judged worthwhile earlier: the core is the part that stabilizes and is touched least, so the FFI cost is bounded while the AI-velocity benefit is ongoing.

**What this fixes across the stack:** jobs = pg-boss/BullMQ; auth = hosted IdP incl. Auth.js; type-sharing = the core's versioned schema artifact → ts-rs/specta + zod; AI = TS SDKs with SSE streaming; DB access = a TS query layer with the Rust core for pure transforms. Context assembly stays unified with the model call (both in TS), so the seam discipline holds.

**Unchanged regardless:** the Rust core, the `MathContent` model, the explicit schema, the frontend, the export/import split, and the reserved futures. The core boundary is exactly what made this decision cheap to take and cheap to revisit.

---

## 18. Current assumptions (v16)

The document's load-bearing commitments, stated once, current as of v16 — correct any that are wrong. Rationale and history live in Appendix A; nothing there overrides this list.

1. **One canonical model.** ProseMirror, KaTeX, LaTeX, Typst, HTML, and the LLM are adapters (§3.18). The Rust core owns types, validation, total non-destructive migration, and canonical operations; TypeScript glue owns product and AI orchestration; client/server schemas are generated from the core (§7, §17).
2. **One user-facing structural axis: `unit.type`** (math-flow role/category). `UnitContent.kind` is the authored form — inferred, never chosen, authoritative inside `content`; any SQL `content_kind` column is a derived projection. **No type↔kind admissibility**: the core rejects impossible structural states only.
3. **Only explicit user cues create authoritative types** (user decision): leading keyword, slash, select-then-mark — *recognized* by the deterministic parser but **user-declared-via-syntax** (`declared_by = user`). The deterministic layer sets form, references, and notation, never `type`; heuristics live in the suggestion beat.
4. **Materialization is greedy + edge-driven + sovereign.** User-declared object-worthy types materialize draft objects immediately; any unit is user-materializable; **edges target objects only, so an edge at a local typed unit materializes it**; AI only proposes (Review Queue), and acceptance enters as user authority with AI provenance.
5. **The binding product contract:** a materialized object remains editable exactly where written. The storage mechanism (re-homing vs origin reference) is **prototype-gated** — first deliverable of slice 2, against the §9.y pass/fail matrix.
6. **Maturity, ranking, and tags control graph noise — not absence** (questions auto-materialize; §6.3b ranking defaults do the filtering work).
7. **`MathExpression` identity is presentation-independent.** Ids are unique workspace-wide; display mode is derived from placement; the toggle composes a placement operation with ordinary split/merge; **copying mints fresh expression ids** (paste-as-reference = transclusion); the expression→unit index is an MVP projection.
8. **The typed knowledge graph is object-only** (a validated invariant). Content-derived references may resolve to notation entries or sources; *passage* references flow through `source_excerpt` objects; unresolved references carry `unresolved_text` on the edge.
9. **Annotations:** targets are rows with structural roles (main | from | to | member) and per-target anchors; **relation semantics live only in `links`** (`backing_link_id`); primitives describe drawing and reference target rows. *Marks are cheap; excerpts are knowledge.*
10. **One fact, one home.** Every projection — `content_kind`, `in_expression`, display mode, search documents — is derived, never independently written.
11. **Provenance is typed and auditable.** Origin ≠ authority; acceptance is explicit (`review_item_id`); derivation chains are FK-checked rows.
12. **`extracted_structure` is candidate-only**: version-bound envelope, a named registry of kinds with acceptance operations; nothing affecting graph, search, rendering, or trust lives only there.
13. **Online-first, server-authoritative, optimistic concurrency** (`revision` + 409); AI candidates are version-bound (§6.4).
14. **Export is a complete `.mathpack`** (manifest + objects + units + edges + assets); projections may emit derived fields for self-description.

*— end of current state. Everything below is historical rationale; nothing in it overrides the body or the list above. —*

## Appendix A — Decision log (v2–v17, historical)

*This appendix preserves the rationale trail (§2.2) across the review rounds that produced the current document. It is a **historical record**: terms inside reflect their era and several are superseded —* lazy objectification *→ greedy capture (v8), `promote_to_object` → `materialize_object` (v8), `mixed` → removed (v11), positional annotation targets → target rows (v14). Current state is the body + §18; nothing here overrides it.*

*(This is **v6**. v2–v5 fixed the architecture, made the model mathematics-first and transparent, decided TypeScript glue/AI, reserved diagrams, and specified `MathContent` as flowing units. **v6 resolves the content model around the authoring UX:** a unit has **one user-facing axis, `type`** (the math-flow label the user sets with a single gesture), with the authored **`content`'s kind inferred, never chosen**, and decomposition deferred to optional **`extracted_structure`** — so the `kind × role` split and its admissibility table are gone (force lived in `type`, not in a shape). The **`type` vocabulary spans the living-math layer** (motivation/intuition/idea/proof_idea/question/open_issue/…) so the platform doesn't bias toward finished exposition; **types are non-exclusive and non-contiguous** (a theorem may carry several scattered intuitions). The **authoring workflow (§9.y)** is specified — user-declared (leading cue, authoritative) > deterministic syntactic inference > LLM-proposed semantics, shape-now/decomposition-later, progressive/local/reversible, history in the log. **Variants are objects + edges** (multiple proofs via `proves`; informal/formal definitions via `equivalent_to`), flavour as labels/tags; **user tags** are their own thin-UI facet. `BoundVar` reserved; `UnitRef` anchor; coarse occurrences (Q3). **Post-v6 refinement:** terminology cleaned per review — a unit is `{type, content, extracted_structure?}` with `content.kind` (prose/math/list/derivation/case_split/mixed/embed/group) internal; `list`/`group`/`embed`/`derivation`/`case_split` removed from the `type` vocabulary (forms, not math-flow functions); and **object boundaries do not leak into the default UI** (§9.y) — the UI shows a continuous document with natural actions (*add another proof, reuse, link, extract*) compiling to `promote_to_object` + edges, with lazy objectification. **v7 (schema hygiene, per review):** the SQL now matches the prose — `content_units.type` lists only math-flow labels (forms are `content_kind`, never types); **one nesting mechanism** (children are rows via `parent_unit_id` + `position` + `slot`; `content` is `unit_content`, ONE unit's own material, never an embedded tree — the units-are-rows decision applied consistently); **inline `$…$` math is an element of prose, display `$$…$$` math is a `math` unit** (both `MathExpression`); **`object.type` ≠ `unit.type`** stated plainly (§6.0b); a type fixes the *role*, never `content.kind` (inferred from material); `proof_step` dependencies are `links` rows, justification a slot child; **`extracted_structure` is never canonical** — acceptance materializes into units/links/typed metadata; annotation note bodies are the annotation object's own units; `application` promoted to a unit type, `example_kind` = illustrative|worked|non_example. **v8 (greedy capture, staged maturity):** reversed the v6 lazy-objectification call — user-declared object-worthy types (theorem/lemma/proposition/corollary/definition/conjecture/question/proof/example) **materialize draft objects immediately and silently** (unit subtree re-homed to the object; host flow embeds inline); discourse types stay units; AI candidates are review_items, hence structurally graph-untrusted until accepted; maturity = the existing object lifecycle (no new statuses); a **dissolution rule** makes materialization reversible; `promote_to_object` renamed **`materialize_object`**. **v9 (both open forks resolved):** *(materialization)* three categories — auto-materialize on declaration (theorem…example **+ question**, by decision: questions are knowledge artifacts; volume is a filtering problem) · local-by-default-but-**user-materializable** (sovereignty: any unit can be elevated) · AI-*suggested* (acceptance required); the **storage mechanism is prototype-gated** behind the binding product contract (*a materialized object remains editable exactly where written*), re-homing the lean with named criteria vs origin-reference; **dissolution is a reviewable operation** when identity is depended on; UI says *Add to graph / Track this*, never "materialize". *(math)* adopted **stable `MathExpression` identity independent of presentation**: expressions carry ids; inline math = expression as prose element, display math = same expression wrapped by a unit (block-level home for future numbering/labels/equation-annotation); **toggle preserves expression id** (placement changes via ordinary split/merge); occurrence edges and a new **`ExpressionRef`** anchor bind to `{expression_id, span}` — stabler than unit-relative spans. **v10 (hardening, per review):** `content_kind=math` = a *placement* of `MathExpression`, not a separate model; **`display_mode` derived from placement**, never independently stored (projections may emit; core normalizes); **`extracted_structure` envelope** `{kind, schema_version, generated_by, base_object_revision, accepted_into?}` + rule (*anything affecting graph/search/rendering/trust never lives only here*); **§6.1d tagged unions** for `target_selector`/`content_locator`/`anchor`/`source_locator`, carried in the §7 schema artifact (open-blob use = build error); **`provenance_derivations`** join table replaces `derived_from uuid[]`; "non-exclusive" reworded (*typed units are not unique per object*; one unit = one type); `application` flagged a strong Add-to-graph candidate; links gain `application_of`/`motivated_by`/`answers`; ownership-prototype matrix expanded (copy/paste, undo/redo, export, backlinks, version history, dissolution); early question-volume filter check. **v11 (one fact, one home — third application of the pattern after kind↔role and display_mode):** `UnitContent.kind` is the union's **authoritative** discriminator (not a second semantic axis); the SQL `content_kind` column is **GENERATED/derived, never independently written**; **`mixed` removed** (structural twin of `group` with a fuzzy intent gloss — `group` is the generic container, and prose already absorbs inline math/refs/marks); the **display toggle composes two operations** (`toggle_expression_placement`, identity-preserving + `split`/`merge`, id-affecting) so each guarantee tests independently; **locator context rule** (ids implicit in `links` pairings, explicit elsewhere); SQL comment fixed so extracted_structure is *proposed-until-accepted*, never decompositions' permanent home; "purely math-flow labels" softened (flow-roles + artifact-categories — the artifact-like ones are exactly the auto-materializers); headings → titled-`group` section semantics reserved; embedded-object "graph-backed" affordance added to the prototype matrix as an open question; `object.type`/`unit.type`: same word, different layers. **v12 (target-schema reconciliation, per review + self-audit):** the **links target mismatch** fixed — `target_id` replaced by FK-checked polymorphic columns (`target_object_id`/`target_notation_id`/`target_source_id`, exactly-one-or-unresolved CHECK, + optional `target_unit_id` refinement), chosen over `target_kind+uuid` to keep referential integrity; **the typed knowledge graph stays object-only** (notation/source targets only on content-derived rows; passage refs flow through `source_excerpt` objects, whole-work refs via `target_source_id`); annotation primary targets get the same pattern (raw PDF marks → source; knowledge-grounding → excerpt objects); **`Symbol` removed from Occurrence targets** (self-audit: vestigial since v5 — no table, no model; reserved with BoundVar); **`declared_by` drops `ai`** (it records who declared the *structure*, a separate fact from content provenance; AI proposals are review_items, acceptance enters as user + AI provenance/derivation); **proof→theorem adjacency**: deterministic `proves` edge when unambiguous, review suggestion otherwise, explicit cue authoritative; **content_units invariants** (same-object parent via composite FK, sibling-order uniqueness with NULLS NOT DISTINCT, content NOT NULL, slot/kind validity in core); `unit_content` storage stated honestly (jsonb + core-owned schema discipline); **extracted_structure kind registry** with named acceptance operations (type suggestions are review_items, *not* this field); worked materialization examples; ownership criteria phrased as pass/fail questions; application graph-visibility watch-item. **v13 (invariant hardening, per review):** **link-target hard invariants** (non-content rows require `target_object_id`; notation/source targets imply `from_content`; unit refinement implies object target) — object-only graph becomes a *validated invariant*; **composite FKs** for `target_unit_id`/`source_unit_id` (and annotation secondary), the same-object pattern applied consistently; **annotation secondary targets unit-refinable** (`secondary_target_object_id` + `secondary_target_unit_id` — "proof step 3 → hypothesis 2" is unit-level on both ends); **provenance.review_item_id** makes acceptance explicit (origin = ai, created_by = accepting user, review_item = the suggestion); **proof→theorem rule narrowed** (exactly-one-unambiguous-antecedent ⇒ deterministic; else review) + **edges survive reordering** (stale/review, never silent deletion); **the type↔kind invariant comment deleted** — it had re-imported the admissibility table; no type constrains content.kind, the core rejects impossible *structural* states only; `unit_content` validated/migrated only through the core; trail `source_passage` steps target excerpt objects (the passage rule resolves it free); `notation_entries.kind` drops `convention` (first-class table now); **§6.3b default ranking explicit** (trusted>draft, title>body, objects>resolution rows, deprecated hidden, mild recency); ownership prototype = **first deliverable of slice 2**, with copy-vs-transclude and clean-undo added to the pass bar. **v14 (annotation targets normalized, per comment):** the v13 `primary_/secondary_target_*` columns are **deleted** (positional columns fail the what-happens-at-three test — the brace/CellSet case was already in the doc) in favour of **`annotation_targets`** rows: structural `role` (main | from | to | member — *never* relational; compared/supports/contrasts rejected as roles because relation semantics have exactly one home, `links`), `position`, the v12 FK-checked polymorphic target pattern + composite-FK unit refinement, and **each target's own selector payload** — unifying the previously split anchor-blob/shadow-columns; **primitives reference target row ids** (what-it's-about ≠ how-it's-drawn) but stay a specified jsonb payload, not a table, since geometry is never queried relationally; partial orphaning becomes representable; MVP annotations = one row, slice-4 arrows/braces add rows, not schema. **v15 (per review + user decision):** **the deterministic layer never sets `type`** — the `?`-heuristic is removed (user decision: only explicit cues — `Q:`/`Question.`/slash/select-then-mark — create authoritative types and hence materialization; punctuation can never mint a graph object; this also resolves the structural-vs-heuristic split with zero new `declared_by` values); **`relation_type` → `backing_link_id`** (a semantic arrow IS a link rendered with placement; fourth one-fact-one-home catch) and **`in_expression` becomes a generated projection** of the locator kind (fifth); **`TargetSelector` = sub-unit refinement only** (unit level = the FK column; anchors keep `UnitRef` in their degradation chain with an equality invariant against the row's `target_unit_id`); primitives must reference rows of their own annotation (core); `AnnotationPrimitive` + `trail_steps.detail` join the §6.1d named unions; stale `annotation_detail.anchor` references fixed; **theorem-like set named** for proof adjacency (theorem/lemma/proposition/corollary/claim deterministic; conjecture → review, a notable event); ranking gains "deprecated unless explicitly searched" + active-trail boost; "semantic constructs" renamed **model constructs** (display-vs-inline is placement, per our own doctrine); `surface_text` rename declined (established surface-vs-meaning vocabulary). **v16 (self-audit, unprompted):** **(1) edge-driven materialization** — v15's theorem-like set included `claim`, but `claim` doesn't auto-materialize and graph edges require objects, so the deterministic `proves` edge was impossible; resolved by the general principle *an edge created at a local typed unit materializes it* (the edge is the first identity-needing action; greedy = declaration time, edge-driven = everything after); **(2) `links.unresolved_text`** + invariant (all-targets-NULL ⇒ text present) — the resolution queue reads the edge, never parses content; the vestigial "NULL alias = awaiting resolution" removed (one mechanism, not two); **(3) expression-id discipline** — unique workspace-wide, core-enforced; **copying mints fresh ids** (paste-as-reference = transclusion); the expression→unit index promoted from "later if needed" to **MVP** (ExpressionRef is in the MVP anchor set); **(4) edge lifecycle vs content** — marker-derived edges sync with markers; deliberate unit-anchored edges go stale/review on deletion, never silently removed (the §9.y proves rule generalized); **(5) tags/taggings schema lands** — decided v6, referenced in prose since, never in SQL (lesson: a decision isn't done until it's in the schema); built FK-checked from the start; **(6)** `example_kind` single-gesture story stated ("Non-example:" = one cue expanding to type+kind); `source_excerpt_detail.anchor_kind` checked and legitimate (its own field, not a stale annotation reference).)*

*(**Post-v16, per the v15 review:** §18 rebuilt as a current-assumptions list with this log moved to Appendix A — split-not-delete: the reviewer's readability complaint was right (stale era-terms muddied the assumptions section, which had in fact become empty of assumptions), and the project's rationale-preservation principle is satisfied by labeling rather than deleting. **User-declared-via-syntax** stated (recognition ≠ authorship; cue types are `declared_by = user`, which is what entitles them to materialize). **Marks-vs-excerpts UX rule** added (casual PDF marks target sources; they graduate to `source_excerpt` objects when they ground knowledge). Small adds: conjecture re-type nicety (reserved), type-aware ranking boost (later), one-link-per-annotation hard-coding caution, slice-2 gate caution. The review's unresolved-payload and exactly-one-target asks were already answered by v16's self-audit — convergent findings.)*

*(**v17, per review + self-sweep:** the review caught the document failing its own v16 lesson — the v8/v9 materialization decisions implied object types (`lemma`/`proposition`/`corollary`/`conjecture`/`claim`) that were never added to `object.type`. Fixed as **Option A, decisively**: first-class object types, costing nothing (the formal family carries no detail tables — enum-only), with the rule **materialization maps `type` by identity**; Option B (a `claim_like` family + kind field) was rejected because it would rebuild for objects the type×kind two-axis structure v6 killed for units. **Edge-driven materialization narrowed**: only canonical edges (deliberate or deterministic) trigger it; content-derived markers structurally cannot (they never target local units); AI-suggested edges materialize at acceptance only. **Claim lifecycle** stated as product reasoning (proof-internal claims stay local; a proved/reused/targeted claim earns identity). **`links.status`** (active|stale|deprecated) gives the §6.1b lifecycle a schema home — scoped to canonical edges; marker-derived edges sync or die, never stale. **`source_id` → `source_object_id`** (naming trap vs `sources(id)`). **Exactly-one-of-four** target invariant (targets ⊕ unresolved_text; unit/selector are refinements, never alternatives). **Type-qualified FK invariants** named in §6.1a. **`anchor_kind` derived** from the anchor's primary selector (sixth two-homes instance avoided — diverging from the reviewer's independent-capture-mode lean for pattern consistency). Tags join split/merge propagation and the ownership matrix (a "central" tag must survive materialization); expression-id rules (move/split/merge preserve, copy mints, transclude references) enter the canonical-operation tests; `example_kind` analogue guard; §18/Appendix boundary made unmistakable (the file order was already correct). Self-sweep for further decided-but-unlanded entities: **snippets checked — table exists** (false alarm); enumeration ripple swept (scope line, objects comment, §6.1c) so the family lands everywhere it's listed.)*

1. **Glue + AI tier is TypeScript (Node)**, Rust core reached via napi-rs (§17 — decided). The **integrity core is Rust**.
2. **Scale = small private alpha/beta initially**, designed to scale to public without rework — so multi-tenancy is light (one space per user, reserved multi-space) and ops are right-sized, not enterprise-scale.
3. **MVP is an online web app**; offline editing and native apps are reserved (§12, §14), consistent with §6 non-goals.
4. **Diagrams are reserved, not in the MVP** (§14) — diagram object type + structured model reserved, no renderer/editor/codegen; **computational exploration is reserved** too (§3.16, §4).
5. **Annotation anchoring is block/span/region for MVP**; subexpression anchoring is reserved (§3.14, §7), which is why **KaTeX** suffices for MVP math.
6. **One AI model provider behind the `LlmProvider` interface**, with BYOK/BYO-endpoint reserved; **three workflows built first** (§8), expanding toward the eleven §5.9 targets.
7. **Markdown/HTML + `.mathpack`** are the MVP export targets; Typst/LaTeX/PDF/Pandoc are reserved (§5.10).

If any of 1–7 is off, tell me which and I'll revise the affected sections — most are localized.
